They aren't even a healthy snack, so do not let that persuade you. That are not an unhealthy snack, so that's a good thing, they are primarily made of corn meal (you know that stuff that has dog lovers up in arms, about the content of their dog food) There is really no nutritional value to this 'snack'.

Since they are made of popcorn, (and not potatos), they are better for one's over-all health -- especially one's eyes.  Potatos are,  (ssady : (  a STARCH, and no matter how much nutrition they contain, they still are loaded with carbohydrates, and starches..... :_(Aha - and Avast, there!  As here come the (very!) friendly 'Pirates', who make 'Pirate's Booty' snacks.  This particular flavour, AGED WHITE CHEDDAR, is totally scrumptious, besides giving the crunchiness that potato chip lovers crave! : )(People who list potato chips as their favourite snacks -- such as Diane Sawyer, (and me!) -- are reputed to show a personality that wants to TAKE CHARGE!  Yep -- potato chip lovers are the natural leaders of the world, those who crave power!I know that both I -- and I'm sure Ms. Sawyer -- want power so that we can do GOOD things for the rest of humanity, abd why not?  (Don't kid yourself -- there ARE, and HAVE BEEN such people, throughout history.  THEODORA, once a slave and then wife of Emporer Justinian was one.  With her power, she wanted to HELP the poor of Byzantium.Really!  Of course, the born aristocrats didn't like THAT toomuch!  Or, THE GREAT of Russia, who worked alongside of workers to help build his palace!  And J.F.K. Jr, (and Sr?) who belonged to the 'ROBIN HOOD SOCIETY', as well as OPRAH WINFREY, (I'm not sure that potato chips were/ are the favourite snack of JFK Jr., (or Senior), or of Ms. Winfrey -- but I'd take a bet on it),..as wellas....well.....DIANE SAWYER, whom I saw on TV saying that potato chips WERE her favourite snack, and....and...well, and hopefully, me, if I ever can find a way to get the wealth and power which my love of potato chips so clearly indicates!)Yet potato chip must, of course, be eaten with discretion, and not with abandon....or one's hope for a healthy life will also soon be....abandned.  PIRATE'S BOOTY, who's major ingredient is not potato chips, but much more healthy popcorn, (here topped with scrumptious aged white cheddar cheese -- also a carbohyrate and starch...but which here, as a topping, is, though one can definitely taste it('s yumminess), is not nearly as much of an ingredient aspotato chips have potatos!  For those who have heretofore only hadthe caramel, Cracker-Jack type coated popcorn, the infinitely lighter, (though still totally scrumptious!) taste of PIRATE'S BOOTY snacks will come as a revelation.  One can find oneself eating just as much of PIRATE'S BOOTY snacks, (especially THIS delightful aged cheddar flavour...at least for me!), as one heretofore did with potato chips!  Only -- much of the guilt is gone, because, ounce for ounce, these PIRATE'S BOOTY snacks are far, far healthier!And -- PLEASE don't think of 'nasty' pirates, such as Peter Pan's Captain Hook, or the real-life Salesian Pirates, when you eat this wonderful snack.  Think of....Caotain Ballows, in the movie, 'The Crimson Pirate', or Dr. Peter Blood, (played by Errol Flynn!), in the movie, 'Captain Blood'.  These are good, and HEROIC pirate figures...pirates who fought for freedom! (And who knows, but that SOME present, real-life 'pirates', may someday soon do the same thing?)Althogh these snacks are NOT vegan, they ARE certified kosher.At any rate -- be sure to FREE yourself of needless calories,and carbohydrates!  Have delicious PIRATE'S BOOTY Snacks, at least half the times you reach for potato chips!  As the Pirate's parrot might say: 'Awwwwk!  They're Goooooood!'"

The downside is that they are fragile and can crumble easily if not handled carefully, You can't just cram these into your under-seat pack. So they are probably not even ideal for cyclists. But once you eat them you'll figure out a way to take them with  you they are that good.They don't pack as many calories as a typical 'bar' but they aren't as dense... so eat a couple. I have no problem with that. I like these maybe even a little too mcuh because I'm tempted to grab one anytime I want a sweet treat.Give em a try.

I used them a few times when training for triathlon, but mostly use them for long canoe races (outrigger canoe in open ocean) when going hard for 3-6 hours.

I used to use Kit Kats and Twix, but the chocolate coating on those can make them difficult to eat when it melts, and sometimes if I ate those super fast my stomach wouldn't like it.  No stomach problems with these.  The one imperfection is that they're a bit greasy, so if you touch them they make your hands greasy and slippery.  Not good when you're paddling.

How do you carry these with you during your workouts? If I put it in my pocket, it crumbles into pieces and is real hard to eat. I much prefer Honey Stinger energy bars because they don't fall apart before I can eat them.Also the price is kind of expensive. 250 calorie Clif bars cost about a dollar each at my local supermarket.

It will crumble therefore don't take it out of th package (the package can catch the falling crumbs)To open is easy, just tear the folded area with your teeth or fingers (the tab in the back where the nutrition info is).  It will open the pack right in the middle exposing half of the waffle.  Just hold the half that's still in the package and start eating.  This is the fastest and safest way to consume this product while on the go (I did just that while hiking, holding my poles in one hand and eating this from the other hand).Haven't tried the chocolate flavor yet but I love all three (strawberry, vanilla, and honey) that I've tried.  Bought Vanilla and Honey from Amazon in bulk.  I know I will finish them based on my scheduled hikes coming up in the remaining 2012.At 160 calories, it is a good hourly snack.

I'm a runner and am in the middle of training for the Marine Corps Marathon (forward).  I tried one of these after going for a 9 mile run.  With water, these are delicous.  If I had to associate the taste to another product i'd say a fortune cookie!"

You know about those energy bars, sure it gives you energy / carbs / protein but they are a pain to eat (way too hard / chewy, nasty tasty, etc). Honey Stinger really hit the spot as a healthy tasty alternative. (I sound like a commercial but I do not work for them... wish I did, then I can just eat them by the case).Of note, I'm a cyclist, so my review will be with a cyclist slant.Wrapping: It's pretty easy to open with the little jagged edge at the top and bottom. When I go ride, I usually partially open the pack to make my life easier.Taste: Man, this thing tastes great. I would eat it for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner. I believe they have different flavors, I usually stick with Honey as the standard.Ease of eating (important for me as a cyclist): The waffles are soft, perhaps a little bit too soft. I think if you hold it at one end, the other end will probably start to sag. But I usually don't hold it long enough before the whole thing makes it to my mouth. This is soft, so you can swallow it in a couple of bites / chews. So much better than some of the energy bars that takes forever to chew and swallow.Cons: The only gripe that I have is that it is crumbly.. little tiny bits will fall off the edges or linger at the edge of your mouth. The other thing is that it is soft, so don't place too much pressure on it or you'll find your waffle shaped like a fortune cookie.Overall, I think this is the best fuel on bike. I usually bring this and some Sport Beans on my ride."

I saw the ads for this and thought 'what next'.  Then I tried one.  Man, these are the bomb!!  They are a delicious change from all the other stuff out there.  They are dry, but easy to eat with a dry mouth. They aren't very sticky either so they are easy to eat while running.  They won't melt when kept in my hydration vest pocket or SPI Belt.  I like em when I'm dong 13+ mile runs now.  I usually eat one every 40 minutes with Honey Stinger chews in between.  They are about 170 calories, but the about 3.5gm of saturated fat.  Seems like alot for something like this."

We'd tried a sample from the LBS and then decided to buy them in bulk. One of the units was opened, so we discarded that, but everything else has been of high quality.They go down well on the ride with a little bit of water. Now if only I could look more graceful in getting the individual packages open while on the ride."

For me this popcorn isn't bad at all but it isn't the best thing since sliced bread either.I bought this to try in my new air popper.  It pops up just fine with very little to none left unpopped.  There might be a few get blown out before it pops but for the most part it pops completely.  It is very bland (of course) being just air popped so you will need to melt some real butter like I do or get creative for seasoning.  I like a pat or two of real butter melted, then sprinkle with garlic powder."

Some days there are a few unpopped kernels and some days not. There is seldom an exploding kernel once an unpopped one hits the bowl (you know what I mean). That's a sign of good popcorn. As it should be, the corn is generally lighter and crisper than the more dense yellow variety.So while this is a good product, I'm not so sure it's better than any other decent brand out there. Just before ordering this 4-pack, I picked up some Lieutenant Kernel brand at Von's (West Coast supermarket) and it turned out to be at least as good as Bob's for about the same price. The advantage of that is you don't need to buy nearly seven pounds at a time. The disadvantage is you need to go in a supermarket (ugh!)."

But once I bought this there is nothing to make me believe that this is it.  It is nice gourmet popcorn... but it is not organic, it is processed in a facility that could cause allergic reactions for food allergy suffers and as far as I can tell it is potentially GMO same as a lot of the corn you buy in the store.  I do not want my 'healthy' popcorn to be possibly GMO!  As far as popcorn goes, it's really good. As far as health food goes, I'm not impressed."
