We bring it on nearly every camping trip but don't set it up unless the mosquitoes are bad or it's supposed to rain.It takes my husband and I a good 10 minutes to set this up. It can be tricky to get all the poles together and then stand them up with only 2 of us. We generally set it up where we want it and then push the picnic table inside. Once set up and staked down, it has always been sturdy, even in strong gusts of wind that come off Lake Superior. When staked down, the walls are taught enough so our 25 lb. dog can't sneak under them and get out.It does keep bugs out so it's worth the hassle of setting it up. We noticed some leaking the first time it rained so we sealed the seams and haven't had any problems since. Of course rain comes in through the sides but it's fine for light rains or rain that comes straight down. We haven't done this but it wouldn't be difficult to hang a tarp from the poles to keep out more rain or wind.Picnic tables in the Minnesota state parks will fit, but there isn't much room to spare. We push one end of the table so it's touching a wall and we have about 3' of walking space on the other end. This is enough room to set up the stove on that end for cooking and room to walk from one side to the other. We could fit a couple camp chairs along with the picnic table but it would be a very tight squeeze. If the mosquitoes are really bad, we'll usually slide the picnic table out after meals and set up our chairs inside. There are fabric loops inside where the roof and walls meet. We use caribiners to clip a little trash bag, towels, keys, or other small items so they're easily accessible but out of the way."

Most of the reviews were favorable so I was unpleasantly surprised when I opened the box. The first thing I noticed was surface rust on most of the poles. Next, I found that the poles didn't really hold together tight like they do on any quality tent, etc. However, I decided to assemble it anyway. The six poles at the top clipped into the center hub and they locked in with a spring clip. This part was OK. After that, assembly was a complete and total disaster! The poles would not stay in place and the entire structure was very wobbly. This was very difficult to set up with 2 people (and I assemble things like this all the time). The stakes they included are useless. I'm not sure what they were thinking. After it was all assembled I noticed a rather large gap under every one of the sides. This will never keep insects out either! I must admit, I was expecting a quality product. Instead, I received a piece of garbage. Thankfully, Amazon pays return shipping.

The polyester top/bottom is the same material as for many Eureka tents, though the polyurethane coating is not as thick, so the water resistance is not comparable to a tent. A tarp over the top will fix this problem easily. The seams & corners are reinforced, and there are no excessive stress points built into the design.The screen house was exceptionally easy to set up -- it took us 5 minutes to set up, including opening the box. The clips are easy to attach. The 6-pole hex design has straighter sides & is sturdier in wind than the square or rectangular designs we tried.My only complaints are (1) the doors are less than 5' high, so I have to duck to get through them, and (2) the stakes that come with the tent are large, thick, plastic things that are hard to pound into the ground, hard to hook to the tent rings, & harder to get out again.

Light rains do not seem to impact interior.- No top vent (gets real stuffy on the inside if you don't use a fan to circulate the air)- Zipper teeth are small and plastic and eventually both zippers went out on this item (two separate doors).

I can say this without hesitation, because my dogs and a horse have tried to kill it.  It probably deserves 5 stars, but it doesn't throw a beam quite as far as I'd like.  Its light is more diffuse than I expected.  Great for nearby illumination, though.  The clip is handy, and it's proved rainproof (and slobber-proof).  I've dropped it on concrete from a 14-foot ladder ... and one of my horses seriously tried to gnaw the lighted end off.  This is one tough little flash.  Rubber grip makes it very easy to hold on to, even when wet (or slobbery).  It will roll off of a flat surface, though, so attach it to a wrist-string when you haul it up on a ladder (or shove it in your pocket).  And don't leave it laying around the barn, because apparently it looks edible to equines.  (And  of course, dogs will gum anything that, to them, remotely resembles a chew toy.)"

The shape feels good in your hand, everything feels rugged, the beam pattern is nice (I thought it might be odd with the four LEDs, but the pattern looks like a single light source once you are a foot away from a surface) and bright.  I wish it had 2 'C' cells instead of 3 'AA', but you can't complain about 20 hours burn time, and it does make the flashlight lighter.  Buy a dozen- all your relatives and friends will want one once they see it.UPDATE- after 6 months of use, these flashlights (I bought 6), are marginal.

I swam around the edge of the pool, looking for a tear at or just below the water line.  The flashlight might have gone a foot or so underwater at most.Two weeks later, the flashlight won't turn on.  Opening up the battery/light compartment revealed water everywhere inside, and rust/corrosion on most of the parts.

I opened one and inserted the 3 AA batteries that came with the flashlights into the cartridge holder, put the light back together, and nothing happened.  I tried the other and it worked immediately out of the package throwing out a bright wide pattern blue-white LED beam.  Switching bateries, cartridges, etc, I pinned it down to the battery cartrdge of the first flashlight.  On close inspection, there is a spring that contacts the negative end of one of the AA batteries that was not held tight by the center rivit connector at the bottom of the battery catridge, and when you placed the cartricge in the flashlight, it would push the rivit up and out of contact with the battery spring, breaking the circuit.  I could have fixed it myself with a soldering gun, but I decided to use Amazons great return policy and am expecting a replacement Thursday.

I took it to a swimming pool thrice... And the 3rd time, water went right in and obviously, the light went out. By a sheer miracle, it did not short circuit... So was able to revive it after drying it out in the Sun... Prima facie proof that if not the 'water-proof' (sic) seal, at least the LEDs are seemingly of good quality.The bright side (which to be remain unbiased, must also be mentioned) - my three experiences in the swimming pool included multiple 06 feet under swims.... and it gave way the last time (if I recall correctly, i.e., after some 10 successful earlier iterations).The flashlight works fine... though I am yet to have the courage to 'truly test it' again...

It is easy to grip in your hand -- light, but not too small, and with a rubberized grip.  The plastic is very sturdy.  The on-off switch is crisp and easy to work with your thumb.  It uses 3 AA batteries for longer life and only slightly more weight than AAA's -- a good tradeoff as far as I am concerned.This one is still new, but I have owned several Dorcy lights and have found that they stand up to a lot of use, unlike a lot of the less expensive LED flashlights that put cheap electronics inside a nicely machined aluminum body.For the price, it can't be beat."

As distance increases, brightness rapidly diminishes.  I was able to clearly see reflective Stop signs at least 500 ft away.  Does light up a backyard area 200 ft away, just not very bright.

If you want a diving light they cost $50 and up. So do not use this for diving in salt water.  If you drop it in a lake, a puddle, the bathtub, the sink or have it in a downpour it will be waterproof and will not let you down.  Read the directions on most water proof watches and they tell you not to use them for diving.  That being said this is a great little flashlight with 4 very bright LED's that make a usefull round floodlight that is great.  When I fix things I can aim this light at the direction of what I am fixing and the flood light pattern makes for a good illuminated work area - actually better than a spotlight for fixing things.  The batteries last a long time and the caribineer clip is helpful.  It costs less than $8 and is a wonderful product for this price.  I had my light float in the bathtub for an hour and it was fine.  If the kids eventually destroy it then I guess I will  spend another $8 - so I give it 5 stars."

It is too bulky to be pocket-sized, but is smaller and brighter than a standard 2D cell flashlight, so it is just right for most uses.  I wish that I had ordered more.  It is a great light for the house and car. I don't think that you can beat it for the money. If you need something brighter, consider the Dorcy 41-4750 for under $20. It is incredibly bright.

I'm not sure what the other 0.1% might be, but I'm going to stick with my original statement :)It's not too heavy and not too light, not too bulky and not too small - it fits the hand very well.  Some might argue that it takes up too much space in the glove box - not true for me.  Its diameter is just a tad smaller than that of a typical 2xD plastic flashlight but it's 70% of the length and 50% lighter, and brighter since it runs on 3 AAs.  It has a non-slip rubberized handle and feels pretty rugged.  Because it's not heavy it would definitely survive a few drops.  The recessed lens is protected from scratches.  The on/off switch action feels solid.  The carabiner on the end is a nice touch.  It's waterproof and it floats too!  I think I'll buy a few more of these before my next camping trip.No, I don't really collect flashlights but I do like them.  This one is definitely a keeper, better than most others in this price range."

I imagined a huge honking heavy flashlight because of its reported brightness and waterproofing. I couldn't be more happy to have been proven wrong. I took this flashlight into a dark room, couldn't even see my hand in front of my face. Turned on the flashlight at it simply lights up the entire room. Its incredibly light, because it saves weight by having 3 AA batteries instead of a huge D battery. Because the lights are LED, they will never go out, which is nice for me so I can just carry an extra set of batteries in my car and never have to worry about it being dead again. Feels fairly durable, but I wouldn't go throwing it at walls or using it as a weapon any time soon. And its small too, the entire handle fits in the palm of my hand, which is nice for me, I don't have to worry about not having a good grip because there is even rubber in the handle for a good grip. I chose this flashlight to take in my car should anything on my car go out, or pop a tire or something. Its small enough to fit in my center compartment with no trouble. Because it has a carabineer built in I can hook it to the underside of my hood when I raise it so I can use both hands to work on my engine if I need to. Now theres always a downside to everything, including this flashlight. Because its made of plastic, its not to durable, should it fall anywhere but the front. The front lights of the flashlight seem well protected because the whole plack front is just rubber, it also keeps the seal water proof. Now I trust this in the rain if its tightened well. I floated it in my sink, seems good. I wouldn't trust it in harsh conditions for more than an hour though. But over all, I love the flashlight, its all I wanted"

I ordered this flashlight towards the end of February (it was delivered to me on Friday, February 22nd). When I got it, I installed the batteries, played around with it a bit and promptly stashed it away. It sat, not doing anything for just about four months. Yesterday, the IA/IL Quad Cities area had a storm that knocked out power for over twenty-two thousand people. My apartment complex was included in the outage. It was out when I got home from work around 5, and was still out when I left this morning around 8.This flashlight was perfect...it worked for everything. And, it's pretty darn bright. Yes, it has a main center circle of light and the outer rings are faded-ish (as they were when I got it), but it really didn't matter. The main circle is bright, just as bright as it was before it went into storage four months ago. One shining moment...the shower curtain in my apartment is black; I kept it outside (I remembered afterwards that it was waterproof, so I didn't test that portion of it); the light that shone through proved fine for showering needs.So, bright light, it worked fine after four months in storage, was great for my needs...in my experience, this little guy is worthy of five stars. And at $7...it was a good deal, too."

We replace them about half as much as any other brand we have. I was worried the low price would mean cheap but these are these are great little quality flashlights.

I use flashlights a lot, and I own quite a few LED flashlights. I have to say this flashlight is average at best. I like its waterproof feature and big, bright yellow case, and the flat rubber top that I can put it on flat surfaces. But one thing bothers me most is the light pattern. It has a narrow bright spot in the middle, then a quite sizable dark ring, and then a thin bright ring around it, and then rings of light. You can see that in the video review posted here. Or you can go to you tube to see in the review someone posted. The light pattern is more visible in very dark areas in those video. The light pattern for my other flashlights I own and like has a bright center with light fading away from it. The light pattern for this flashlight is very distracting. I can only see the bright center spot clearly. I have to move the flashlight to see the areas next to it. It limits the area the flashlight covers. Yes, the center spot is very bright.

They have survived drops on the trail, and dunks in the lake with shining colors.  They float in a horizontal position in very shallow water, and are genuinely waterproof.I highly recommend the Dorcy 41-2510 waterproof, floating LED flashlight!"

You see in the photo that it has 4 seperate LEDs, but when turned them on they converge into a single beam.  It isn't a narrow spot beam that shines for long distances, it is a wider beam with a fair amount of spill on the sides.  I like this kind of beam for a general use light.  I own a few other LED flashlights and the beam is so tight that they are hard to use close up.  I also want to mention this is not a &#34;pocket&#34; light, it is a handfull but isn't very heavy.

Don't get me wrong, it's not going to light up an entire alley way, it was just brighter than I anticipated.It's bulkier, bright yellow, and rubberized handle and top to help absorb any shocks from a fall or knock over.Too many flashlights are all black, so the high visibility yellow is a plus to me, standard AA batteries are sold everywhere, a plus for anyone.The best thing about this light is the price tag, at just 7 dollars this is an impressive light. You can get lights far cheaper with batteries at Walmart, I call those cheap outdated flashlights 'disposable flashlights', once the battery is drained, throw the whole thing away and buy another one since the batteries to replace cost more than the flashlight itself that comes with batteries. This Dorcy isn't a disposable, I like the light and body, and brightness.$7, just 7 dollars, buy it if you're considering this light.

The problem is, the loop is larger than the knotted rope, and can easily slide out when getting on the hammock or moving around in it.  I am not a heavy person (&#60;150 lb) and had the hammock securely fastened, but this happened anyway.  I tested it after it happened and was able to easily repeat when pressing on the hammock at the right angle.  You will potentially injure yourself if you use this product.

I don't have any trees in my back yard so I just tied it up under my trampoline. I found this really helpful in allowing my girls to learn how to use it because if they fell it was only a couple inches and onto grass. I would highly recommend doing something like this if your getting this for your kids.You should know that it does not come with any ropes to tie it to anything so I just used some tiedown straps from my garage. It only has these open ended S hooks you can latch onto but I didn't think that was safe enough for my little girls so I bent them closed with some vice grips. I found some cheap carabiners at Home Depot for like $1 each to attach to both ends that seemed much safer. Even with the carabiners they still fold up nicely into their bags.The material is really soft and compared to those mesh ones it's AMAZING!I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the S hooks.

After two days of light use I (a 150 lbs male) fell straight through it when I went to lay down one morning while camping. So despite its claim it can take up to 250 lbs.

There are some that are smaller, lighter, and more compact but I didn't have $75 to $100+ to spend on a hammock.  It doesn't come with any kind of tree straps or extra rope, so if you don't already have any decent rope laying around at home you can pick up a roll of 100ft of utility rope (various colors) with a 244lb load limit for under $10 at Home Depot.  That's more than enough since your weight is split between both ends of the hammock, and you'll have 80+ feet of good rope left over which is never a bad thing.  The complete package, with the rope is very light weight and much easier to carry on a camping trip than a tent.  A tarp is a good addition, string a rectangle tarp in an A configuration or a square trap in a diamond configuration over the hammock to keep dry.  Dave Canterbury has a very good video on YouTube demonstrating a good way to hang a hammock and fly a tarp above.  Check out his 'wildernessoutfitters' channel and watch the 'Trail Tarp Set up Options Part 1' video.  This how I'm set up for camping for the time being.

The main disadvantage is staying warm. so you'll still need a pad for insulation.If you like using a hammock, then go get a good one.  I got a Hennessy Hammock that I'm happy with.

IT fits the body well, is extremely easy to hang up and even has the attached storage bag for convenient storage. It is super lighweight, yet seems pretty sturdy. Unlike a lot of other hammocks of this style, the middle area doesnt ride up when sat in-which is incredibly painful or at least distracting- and the hooks are attached strongly. Lots of reviews have said that they split down the middle after only a few uses- which is understandable considering the strain that the middle section of the material must hold- but even the expensive hammocks will do that. Just be careful when getting in and out of it, and keep sharp objects out of your pockets, and it should last a while. Like anything else, it will last longer the better you take care of it. Ive had mine for about 5 months now and even with regular use it is still in perfect shape. It is even resistant to mold, which is really nice.

For the weight it seems pretty tough, I put some strain on it and the seams and threads did not pull. I strung it up today with some paracord and tried it out.  I did not want to get back out again, it was so comfortable and comforting. I love hammock camping because hammocks are so much lighter, smaller, and simpler than tents, and sleeping on the ground hurts my back, even with sleeping pads.You'll need to get some paracord, rope, or straps for it. To make it complete and usable for camping, I bought the paracord, Coghlan's mosquito net for about $3-4, and I already have a small tarp for shelter (I suggest a tarp about 9 feet long to keep rain out). I'll also use the paracord to string up the netting and the tarp.Adjust the length of your ropes or straps you use to attach the hammock to a tree. It goes down when you put your weight in it so it should be nearly horizontal without weight (unlike the picture), unless you like it slung more like an easy chair and less like a bed.This model is so much cheaper (I paid $16) than the models with attached netting (like $40 to $100 or more), and the netting only costs a few dollars separately, so this seemed like the better deal.

My primary use is 3 season light weight hiking/back country camping. I use it with a sil-nylon rainfly, a 3/4 length Ridge Rest SOLite, a light weight sleeping bag, a little DEET40 and sleep like a baby. I used to be a tent guy for all seasons, but have since realized the joys of ultralight hiking (under 20 lb loaded pack for a long weekend; food and water included). BTW: Hammocks are very comfy once you get the diagonal sleeping thing down.  I recently bought another from Amazon for my wife. This one did not come with tree straps, not a big deal when Amazon was nearly giving them away. They set up in less than a minute and take down in less than 30 seconds. I've tried others. In fact my son has an ENO (a bit heavier and more$$) and a friend of mine has a Clark (a lot heavier and big$$$).

The description does not match the product I received... it notes ropes are included; not so for me. Still, I sort of figured that and for the price and after reading some other reviews that pointed it out, I am OK with it.This is a simple, hammock day-use system with the possibility of add ons.This is a terrific value. My daughter longed for a Grand Trunk Skeeter Beeter Pro 'just like Daddy's,' but while my daughter is worth the money, I wanted to get her something less expensive in case it wasn't her thing. She was THRILLED with the ultralight and I was impressed with it, too. I look forward to hijacking it for short hikes and single-day kayak trips. It certainly lives up to its name. It's very light and it's also very comfortable.NOTE: It DOES NOT come with additional components. You get a hammock, fit into its own bag, and two S hooks that attach it to a strap system (not included). Some folks say it comes with a suspension system; mine didn't. Hammock, S hooks and bag are what I got for $15. Still, I am happy with the purchase.What else you need:1) Bug net. I'd guess you're looking at $40 for an aftermarket product that is high quality. You may make/stitch something cheaper, but $40 is the starting point of a ready-made net.2) Ridgeline - 100 inches of cord are cheap. Use poly cord, not nylon; nylon stretches. This can cost as little as $1,3) Tarp - a silnylon 9 foot tarp is the minimum. It can go across your ridgeline and you can attach nylon cord for guylines. Estimated cost - $40 for a cheap one. Super light tarps can get very pricy. I find silnylon works fine for me.4) Last but not least, straps. You can buy some for about $15 and this can serve as your suspension system or you can make your own. You can pay more for whoopie slings, strap system, carabiners, special ropes, etc.By the time you're all in, you can count on spending $115. Still a great buy for a hammock system.My advice is know what you want and if cheap, light and simple is the answer, this is a terrific value.EDIT: Being pleased with my first one, I ordered three more: One for my brother, one for my wife and one for my other daughter.

None came with ropes long enough to span the distance between most hanging points I would find hiking.  To be honest - I have found that 1' woven mesh works perfectly for hanging my hammocks - it has very little elasticity - so your hammock hangs where you put it (eliminating the need to overtension the hammock before you get in).This hammock is comparable in construction to the ultralight byer hammocks I have owned in the past.  It is, however, larger and safely accomodates my 260# frame without difficulty.  By sleeping slightly diagonal in it, I am able to lie close to flat.  The enlarged height and width allow me to go a bit more diagonal than in a byer, so I get a more comfortable resting position.I have also found that the ropes are shorter than those on a byer.  Since neither is long enough and you have to bring your own tree ropes anyway, this is not an issue.One difference though.  The hammocks of this material that have different colors sewn together can be stronger due to those seams (or weaker) depending upon quality of construction.  The seams help reduce some of the elasticity of the hammock and allow you to lie a bit flatter because of it.  This one piece cloth hammock has a tendency to 'coccoon' over you if you go off diagonal and lie in line with the attachment points.  I have found that just hanging a foot or elbow off the corresponding sides reduces the tendency for a side to raise up and lets me see what's going on just fine.  With traditional rope hammocks you do not have this to deal with though.One final caveat:  For 20 bucks for a hammock you can fit into a cargo pocket - it's quite a deal.  It may not be as comfortable as a larger rope hammock in the long run, but those things are HUGE and HEAVY - I would not consider taking one car camping, let alone backpacking.  This one goes with me everywhere."

I ordered one of these back in April as a gift. Even though this item qualified for free 2 day shipping, it said the hammock would not be shipped until the middle - end of May. Now the status says it will not be shipped until the end of June. Obviously Amazon is out of these hammocks for right now, possibly until the end of June, or later.If you read this much later when they have these hammocks restocked, the hammock is good quality. It does not include cords for the S hooks to attach to, which is probably why the product is so cheap.

The material is comfortable, though beware it's very breezy so it's not ideal for cold nights but I lay on it with a nice sleeping bag in the early morning hours and it was pretty comfy.  I'm only giving it four stars though because the little rope ends are pretty darn terrible.  One of the knots at the end of mine actually came undone while I was getting in the hammock for the fourth or fifth time.  Upon retying it I realized just how short they really are; it was difficult to tie a decent knot with that minimal length.  I'll definitely be replacing the end ropes and I agree with the other commenter who suggested swapping the s-hooks for carabiners.

Now i dont have a whole lot of testing or use on this product only very little. These are more of my initial thoughts and views on product.

Anyway back to the hammock. The hammock was initially turned on to me by my scout leader, he said it was a good hammock and was wondering if i would like one, he would then by some multiple ones for himself and some of the other scouts making it cheaper because of shipping. I said sure ill take a look at it and get back to you. Well i was overwhelmed by how many good reviews and positive things wear said about it and the price was just amazing! so i followed through and said sure count me in. A few days later i picked it up. and was pleasantly surprised at how much 'AWESOMENESS' i just got for under twenty bucks. Its looks like the stitching will hold up fine and the ropes and everything looked good. Plus its only 12 oz. which got me excited in the beginning. So far i recommend you pick this hammock up.I will try to get back to this review ASAP with more data on the durability and all that fun stuff.thanks, marshall3win"

"359","XX","B001AIBJNS","5.0","March 1, 2011","A9RTRKZM3IEOY","Comfortable Hammock, Great Value","This really is a terrific hammock and is a steal at the price they are going for.  I've been using mine for months and below are some points based on my experience with it so far:Quality:  This hammock is extremely lightweight and not built as tough as some others out there.  While very light, the material seems to be of good quality and has held up well so far.  They've really given you a lot of material, as I can nearly wrap myself up in it, burrito-style, when lying in it.  (Reviewer is 6'2' and 185 lbs. for reference)  The edges are nicely finished and the ends are nicely and securely bound.  When lying in it, there do seem to be points at which the fabric is more stressed than others, but I can't find any rips or tears in the fabric or at the stitching after much use.  The hammock comes with a set of knotted cord to use for suspension between points.  They could be a bit longer to suit me, but have performed just fine.  Despite the relatively narrow gauge cord, they are high quality and have not abraded or stretched unusually.  The hammock comes with 'S' hooks rather than carabiners, but they work well.Lightweight:  As I mentioned, this is one light hammock.  It may not matter if you're using it in your back yard, but this baby is a real weight-saver if you are packing it in on your back.  It packs to nearly nothing in terms of size, and in terms of size and weight it amounts to about the same as three pairs of hiking socks.  It is hard to beat for a minimalist trip to the back country in fair weather.  Should it get wet, or after you wash it, it dries super quick, providing a bit of sun...Comfort:  There really is nothing like the slumber you get gently swaying in a hammock.  The only thing I can compare it to is the sleep one gets on a gently rocking boat.  This particular hammock is very comfortable, with just the right amount of give and plenty of size to change positions and stretch out.Durability:  So far, so good.  Though I've used it frequently, I've also used it very gently:  No shoes, no keys in the back pocket, no dropping in it cannonball-style.  Even gently lowering myself in, a couple of times I've heard stress 'pops' where the fabric gathers at the ends as it takes my weight, though I've not detected any damage.  The S hooks have worn well, and I have been very impressed with the suspension cords that came with it.  The cord hasn't stretched as far as I can tell, and despite the relatively small diameter, they have shown only minimal abrasion wear due to tree bark, posts, etc.  With careful use, this baby has treated me right for a long time.Value:  This one is huge.  A quality hammock, S hooks, stuff bag (attached to the hammock so it won't get lost), AND a set of knotted suspension cords all for a little more than a large pizza with two toppings??  Are you kidding me?!  (OK, so there may be some regional differences on the price of the aforementioned pizza.  Still!)  I would have expected - and been happy with - well under the use I've already had out of this, and it's still going.  Massive value here, especially when you consider that you could get two or three of these for the price of some other hammocks...Other thoughts:  I love this hammock, I would buy it again in a second, and I can totally recommend it.  However...  Keep in mind this is a lightweight - stop, read ULTRAlight - hammock.  I've used it much, though gently, and it has worked great.  Ultimately, I would not expect it to last as long as something a bit heavier.  Now, this may or may not matter depending on your use, how much you weigh, how often you use it, etc.  Personally, I would think twice about relying on this as my only source of accommodation for an extended trip in the back country - I'd want either a slightly heavier hammock or a back up in addition.  Mind you, mine has yet to fail.People have asked me about upgrading to carabiners.  Frankly, I think they are superfluous for this purpose as the S hooks are perfectly good and secure, and it's the fabric that will give long before the S hooks.  Still, if you've already got them, then go for it.For the quality and price, this one just can't be beat.  Get it, kick back, and relax.  Heartily recommended at five stars."

I wasn't willing to spend alot and didn't want one that would need to be stored after every use.  When I viewed this one I was sure that it was too cheap to last very long, but at least I would find out if I would use a hammock or not.  I was pleased with the weight and ease of installation, but really impressed with the comfort level.  This is one tough hammock and very comfortable.  I made the mistake of having our burn pit too close and some sparks actually burned small holes in about 10 areas.  This, I was sure, was going to be the end of my hammock because surely it would cause it to rip.  Not one burn hole has begun to rip.  My husband, who is close to the weight limit, loves this hammock and has one of his own.  Buying this hammock was originally an experiment to see if we would get any use out of our hammocks prior to buying one that is more expensive.

I use it in my day pack as an 'in case I get stranded overnight' solution when I'm hiking and fishing away from my normal load I carry in the canoe's big bag.I've also lent this hammock to others ranging from my 14 yr old son, to my wife, to a buddy who on nite two of our trip was insanely jealous of my NOT hurting back while he took 2 hours to 'limber up' after his night on the ground.My number 1, all the time hammock is a system - the claytor jungle hammock - it's hammock, bug tent, and tarp all in one, it's quite huge compared to this and weighs 3 pounds all together (more than 3x this) and makes a giant area I can live under, cook under, etc.  BUT for a day hike emergency, a back up, or a loaner - this hammock is perfect.I carry a few ounces of painters drop cloth with Duct Tape on the corners for an emergency tarp with this Grand Trunk hammock, and a mosquito head net, all inside the same stuff sack that's attached to it, and it works fine...in a pinch...which is why I'm carrying it.It also can be made to condense much smaller than it arrives - just wind the tree straps into a smaller ball, roll the hammock really tight, use some rubber bands...and you can get this into the size of a softball or grapefruit easily.

The cord system that comes with it worked very well and it was easy to set up.It did however, get static buildup if you roll around in it, as I did when testing it out, but once you put blankets in and get stationary that wasn't a problem. It is a pretty comfortable one person hammock, and is big enough that you are almost cocooned inside. But blankets didn't work very well with it, they kept sliding down, because the hammock's not very flat when you're in it, so I would suggest a sleeping bag inside as well if it's cold.And as usual I think with all hammocks, you lose body heat really easily at night, so I did get freezing in it, but so did the other campers with me, with different types of hammocks so I don't think that was a particular shortfall of this one. It seems to be more of a sleep hammock than a relax hammock, although it could work like that I beleive.

One of the joys of this trip is hooking up my hammock to a couple trees and chilling out while reading a book.Prior to getting this hammock, I had used a very inexpensive, braided nylon hammock. It was about as basic as you could get... just nylon braided rope with a couple metal rings at either end. The major problem is that after a few minutes, I'd have severe rope mark indentations in my skin if I didn't first line the hammock with my sleeping bag. But it packed very small (about the size of an orange), was light-weight and worked like a champ. It could also be used to hoist food into the air at night to keep food away from marauding animals.This Ultralight Hammock ( I got the Royal Blue color ) is so much better though. It is also lightweight, but since it is not a braided hammock it is much more comfortable. Plus the integrated storage 'pocket' makes a great place to stash a paperback book while you're dozing off in the hammock. The included S-hooks and pre-knotted rope are so easy to use when hooking your hammock up to trees. I was a little skeptical that the S-hook and knots would work as well as they do but after many 'hangings' I've never been let down (pun intended) inadvertently.This is such a nice addition to my camping equipment that I can't imagine ever being without it on a camping trip. I'm no lightweight at 215 pounds and this hammock holds me just fine.Love the Ultralight Hammock. I'm going to find a photo of me and my hammock and post it in the customer image area."

The ropes are doubled over with knots tied at intervals so you can attach one end to a hook in a wall or tree (better not to put hooks in trees though) and attach the S-hook to a suitable knot for the height you want. The ropes aren't long enough to wrap around trees unless they are small and really close together, but there was plenty for our set-up where we had two posts with hooks in them. We tied an extra knot in the rope to fine-tune.  You can get similar rope pretty cheaply, special hammock straps, or I've read suggestions elsewhere about adapting non-nylon (nylon stretches) vehicle tie-down straps. Others have suggested replacing the s-hooks with carabiners which sounds nice but 2 of the carabiners I priced would cost more than the hammock! A carabiner might be slightly more secure but I doubt the hammock will jump off a s-hook if there's weight on it.The fabric is thin but strong and cool. For coolish weather lie on a thin blanket.Once we had things adjusted for our location it takes about 30 seconds to put up the hammock.I read reviews about this hammock and several others before deciding on this one. Others may have a bit more structure, but for the price this one seems to do pretty much what a hammock needs to do without making it a major family financial investment decision."

My other held my buddy who weighs 205.  We actually slept them bunkbed style since we only had two trees on the site that'd work.  Now they held us fine, however, if you toss or turn in your sleep or like to sleep on your side this isn't the overnight hammock for you.  GREAT dayhike hammock and if you're a nonmover when you sleep it'll be perfect, but I had to wake up enough to be coherant enough to gently adjust myself.  The one time I got too comfortable with the hammocks integrity and just rolled over it sounded like fibers ripping.  Now the hammock didn't rip that I can see but it was enough to respect it's delicacy the rest of the trip, especially with my buddy underneath my hammock.So all in all, it's GREAT for the price, GREAT for dayhikes, GREAT for kids and GREAT for recreational events.  Sleeping overnight, even though I love my GT, I got an ENO double so I didn't have to worry about it giving on me while adjusting throughout the night.  Ropes on the GT work fine but 550 paracord works just as well if you need more length (I did this exact thing and worked perfectly)All in all great for the price and as far as weather protection just get a cheap tarp from walmart.  An 8x10 was big enough to cover our hammocks and put a camp chair under and wait out the 6 straight hours of rain we ended up getting.  We were off the ground and bone dry.  Less than 30 bucks for one of the most comfortable nights sleep I've had outside."

I used it on a deer hunting trip and I love that it is a solid fabric instead of the nylon netting.

That doesn't happen with this one. It was really comfortable and it appears as though it will hold up the to use that I will put it through.I like the cords that it came with to wrap around the tree so that you then just hook the 'S' hook into them. I could see how carabiners might be better than the 'S' hook and I'll probably get some of them but the hook worked great.I also really like that it has a storage bag that is attached to the side of the hammock.

I didn't even realize it came with the ropes when I purchased it. They make this fully adjustable for various spaces. The instructions for using the ropes are very easy to understand, and I had this up in under a minute. Fabric is cool and breathable, and so easy to wrap up into the attached bag. This is just as good as another brand I had that was double this price! It comfortably supported my husband who is 175 lbs. Ordering another one today and I plan to give many as gifts.***Update, 5/2011: I purchased 2 of these. After only owning one for 7 months, it split right down the middle, dropping me to the ground. No, I'm not fat, didn't have anything sharp in my pocket, and wasn't using it incorrectly. I contacted the manufacturer who wanted me to pay to ship it back to them so they could mail me a replacement. I didn't feel like paying $6.00+ to ship an item that was only $16 to begin with, so I just took it as a loss, and used my second one cautiously. Yesterday, the second one I own (which is now 10 months old) just did the exact same thing and split right down the middle as the first! This is VERY thin, and there's just no way that it can withstand multiple uses over a long period of time. Invest in one that is thicker. So disappointed because I LOVED it at first.  Guess you get what you pay for. Be careful!!***Update, 6/29/2011: After both of mine ripped, I contacted the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I felt like maybe there was an issue with the manufacturing and wanted to make sure no one else would get hurt. They sent my report to Grand Trunk, and I received a call from their office. The guy I spoke to was extremely friendly and apologetic. He ensured me that it wasn't a common issue, but that they have had other complaints over the years. Because the material is so thin, it doesn't take much to puncture it, thus causing it to possibly rip. I mean, it's less than $20, so I get that. He wanted to make it right, and sent me a replacement right away, but gave me the model that's thicker and more durable. Fantastic customer service. I'd go ahead and just purchase the thicker hammock made for 400 pounds. The company is great, and I'll certainly continue to purchase from them after they did what was necessary to make me a happy customer again."

We used all 3 hammocks camping this weekend and all of them performed well.  The Grand Trunk hammocks, though, were much lighter material, and with a small breeze, kept you much cooler in the hot/humid climate in Texas )it was over 90 this weekend).  I think the ENO hammock will outperform the Grand Trunk hammocks in the cooler months as it is bigger and the thicker parachute nylon.  But for summer camping, and for children/small adults  - for the price - I would definitely recommend the ultralight Grand Trunk hammocks.Also, they do come with ropes that are easy to use, and very sturdy."

I bought one for my fianc&eacute; and one for myself and we put them up immediately to start lounging.  We then brought them camping with us and everyone that went with us (11 other people) had to have their turn in the hammock.  I even had a few friends swinging in them.  They are strong, dry fast (it rained on them) and are very comfortable.  My fianc&eacute; took a two hour nap in one and I took I fell asleep while listening to friends in the other.  The fact that the stuff sack is attached is very helpful.  We did not have any problem with the hammock and had people weighing at least 180-190 lbs sat in it and apparently others had problems with the ropes but we didn't .  I highly recommend these."

My buddy has a high quality kind of the same style that he takes on every backpacking trip he goes on, that way he does not need to pack a sleeping mat or tent (he also has a rain fly for his that he purchased separately). I never tried his out but liked the idea so much that I searched for one of the cheapest hammocks of this style and this is the one I found. I actually love it, but the ropes it came with are not too practical because they are quite short which limits the versatility of where to put it up, but you can get any other length of rope for pretty cheap almost anywhere that will make this much more versatile.The first time I used it I set it up at a children's park in between the play structures while my brother had baseball practice. I just wanted to test it by laying in it and reading a book, but when I sat in it something popped and it fell slightly. It ended up being because of the way the construction of the hook is attached to the hammock. I am 6'2' and 145lbs (so I doubt it will hold 300lbs comfortably but I could be wrong). When this happened it didn't break, but it frayed the rope attached to the hammock a little bit. Since then I have yet to have a problem. It IS pretty comfortable and I actually carry it with me in my school backpack when attending college, that way I can kick back and relax or study outside whenever the weather permits it.I would recommend this item, like I said, to anyone who is skeptical about this style and doesn't want to invest in an expensive one.

My 9 year old son is now starting to backpack with us and wanted to sleep in a hammock like his dad and big brother.  I wasn't sure how much he would really like it so I bought this one because you can't really go wrong for 18 bucks.The quality seems good and I think it seems more durable than some other reviewers have reported.  My son loves the silky feel and how it wraps him in securely when he sleeps.  He played with it pretty roughly in the back yard the day it came and it didn't seem any worse for wear.We took it camping this last weekend.  He slept in it under a tarp in the rain all night.  In the morning he was so excited to tell everyone he had slept out in a hammock all night.  He was comfortable and slept well.  He like it so much that he has slept in it in the back yard the last 2 nights.  It seems to be holding up well and has been a quality purchase.The stated weight limit on this hammock is 250 lbs.  I figure I weigh 220, so if I started swinging or bounced a little in it, the force would quickly exceed that limit.  Seems to be more appropriate for kids or pretty small adults.  The sturdier hammocks from this brand hold up to about 450 lbs (i think).  That is what I use and I have probably logged about 50 nights in mine.Great value for 18 bucks.  I would highly recommend this.  Just read the description and don't push it beyond the stated specs."

The Eno straps absolutely suck, I've wrote some reviews on that subject so I won't get into it now except to say STAY AWAY and go with the Kammok Python Straps.I've been a fan of Grand Trunk since having a great experience with their parasheet and customer service, great for the beach and ok for picnics at the park, sometimes just a little to thin for some kinds of rough grass. I've used the Grand Trunk Ultra about 20 times and it was great. It holds my weight fine, 175 pounds, but I'm hesitant to let my kids lay in the hamock with me since reading more than a few reviews about it ripping while lying in it. I have to make my 5 and 7 year old kids take turns if they want to lay in it with me. Just a overprotective dad i guess.I always knew that if I really liked these types of hammocks that I would purchase a sturdier hammok and keep this as the hammock I use and abuse, throw in the car, lay in dirty, hot, and sweaty after yard work or completely wet from swimming....for the price it's perfect.I ended up buying the Kammok in nakura blue/stone gray since I was so impressed with the python straps, quality stitching, and to be honest the cool color. Anyways, this will be the hammock I'll be less inclined to ' Get Dirty ' and my Grand Trunk Ultralight will be like your once favorite pair of tennis shoes that you wore out and now use to cut the grass with...hey I love those shoes still!!!For price and usabilty I'm giving it 5 stars."

Very light, and amazingly strong.  I weigh about 230, and there is no hint of strain or being close to any limit.  Amazing how such a thin material can be so strong.  I have occasionally found that there are not enough trees located within the range of adjustment of the ropes that come with the hammocks, so I made some knotted rope extensions that greatly increase the flexibility of where to hang it.  The self-storing pocket is large enough that I can even stuff my two ropes per hammock into the pocket with the hammock.

Only four stars because you still need a bug net.I would buy this again and or gift it."

This review will not be helpful for the durability. That said, I used this and found it to be very comfortable and very lightweight. To lighten the weight even more I removed the s- hooks, and used the rope provided to fish through 550 cord. Now I can hang it without using the S hooks at all. It packs up into its own carrying case and easily fits in there."

Any flaw, whether from manufacturing or from use is a potential problem down the road, if not immediately.That being said, we have three of the Grand Trunk Ultralight Hammocks and use them for backpacking as well as general hanging everywhere we go. All three have survived for over two years with steady use. This includes use by two less than careful teenagers and their friends, who leave hammocks out in the rain for several days...The S-hooks have worked fine, although replacing them with a set of load-rated carabiners would probably make one feel more confident in the setup.I would buy this hammock again.

But too late, because the next time I used it the tiny tear ripped the entire distance across the hammock, and I fell to the ground.

I have tried out many hammocks both costly and cheap in my quest for the best one in relation to camping, these include DD Frontline Hammock (which I own), EMO, textsport and others. This has been my best hammock so far.This hammock is as comfortable as many of the expensive ones (as long as you aren't too tall, I am 6'1' and its fine), and yet it is also the lightest I've found comprehensively browsing all which exist out there (with the exception of the nano from grand trunk as well... if you're willing to pay 3 times the price). I used it on a month long biking tour through France and England, and it held up great. It was always the thing to look forward too at night. I would rather sleep in this in the woods then have someone kindly invite us over for the night; cause with this I would get a good night's sleep.There just isn't any price/weight/comfort ratio to match this bargain out on the market!

There have been improvements made to the Zipper and zipper guard, as well as slightly better fabric on the shell.  This review is for the correct bag, which I received after returning the one that was sent by mistake.First, about the bag... I like it a lot. The black and grey look great, it is warm without being too warm  or giving you hot-spots, and I have had no trouble with the new zipper getting caught or coming undone. It is not meant to be a backpacking bag, but for a regular camping type bag, it is small and light when put away in the stuff sack, and goes into the sack without a lot of fighting or strategic rolling to get it to fit. Honestly, for the price, this is a great bag! I would not feel cheated if I paid another $20 for it. If you are looking for a cool weather bag that will keep you warm, but not cook you out on the 70 degree nights, this is your bag.I also want to tell you about the company. I returned the first bag I was sent because of problems with the Zipper. As usual, Amazon made it easy to do, and a new bag was ordered before I had even boxed the old one, which UPS came and picked up the next day. What I did not expect was to be contacted directly by North Star to ask me specifics about what went wrong. We discovered that I had been sent an older, different bag by mistake, and they told me that they had changed to a stronger zipper and zipper guard material. I talked back and forth with them a few times, and the customer service was some of the best I have ever encountered on Amazon. (And I buy a lot from Amazon!) The replacement bag arrived earlier than I would have expected, and it was clear when I saw it that I was dealing with a different bag. I can't say enough good things about North Star, or this particular bag, so if you are looking for a good deal, and you want to know that you will have good service backing you should you need it, go with North Star. I would give an extra star if I could."

I personally removed the waist strap, but would probably leave it on if hiking or using in the deer woods. I like the size, as I tend to carry more stuff then I will ever need, if it was bigger I would only carry more crap. The biggest pocket works perfect for a jacket, thermos or two, and a book. One review complained about the size, I personally like that it's not bulky, nor allows me to be.If you carry anything of substantial weight you will have to figure out a way to get the shoulder straps to stay. They suck, I just tied mine into knots where they will no longer slip. A safety pin would probably stop them from slipping as well. The pieces that adjust the strap length (at top) does not have teeth in them. Again a simple knot and I have had no issues since.The stitching did come loose in one spot, it took me a total of 15 mins to repair.With the above mentioned problem, I'm still giving this pack 4 stars, since it's extremely affordable compared to the Maxpedition pack that is over 100 and looks identical. Why I paid an extra $30 for the A-Tacs color/pattern I don't know.Also there is no padding for a laptop (padded sleeves are cheap), but at some point will probably carry a laptop in it. I don't plan on skydiving with it in there. The main compartment is listed at 18x10. Zipped up I would say this is probably closer to about 15' tall, the center may be 18' but the top-side area is rounded. My laptop is 17' and is too heavy to carry around anyways, when I get my 15' I will see if it fits while in a padded sleeve.I would buy this again, and would recommend this product."

I chose the Condor bc of the back padding over the voodoo, and also bc it been compared to high quality backpacks like maxpedition(a/b $140). You get the same quality for a/b half the price. What separates the maxpedition pack from condor is that maxpedition has a few more M.O.L.L.E. places for attachments and its is slightly larger.

This pack has plenty of room in the separate compartments.  The sizing and color of the pack were just what I expected.  It was delivered as promised.  There are plenty of molle attachment points.  They are spaced evenly and seem to be solid.  I have the 10x4 water bottle pouch attachment and it fits perfectly on either side of the pack.  I plan on getting a second 10x4 to keep my cook kit in.There are two things that I have had an issue with:** My only real complaint - The shoulder straps are attached by slide buckles at the top for adjust-ability.  It took a while to get the right fit dialed in, and that's OK.  The problem is that as I am hiking through the woods, the shoulder strap attachment slips.  The shoulder strap is not fully padded.  So when it slips you have the thin webbing pulling on your shoulder.  This takes a while for this to happen.  Hopefully after several more short trips, the webbing and buckle 'get trained' to stay in the original comfortable position. ** Minor issue - I will sew a key keeper/mitten hook to the inside one of the compartments to keep my keys secured inside the pack."

But what good is all this if its uncomfortable to tote around.  I was disappointed with the shoulder straps.  They are quite flimsy and rather uncomfortable for smaller framed people like myself.  The bottom shoulder straps hook to the pack at a weird angle which makes the upper shoulder part rub partly into your arm pits.  I've tried adjusting the straps multiple ways and still run into this rubbing issue.  I think I'm actually going to take the pack in and get it altered so that top part is fixed to the pack and NOT attached via a small adjustable strap. In it's current state the shoulder straps like to twist on you.  Again this is a nice pack, but I think unfinished in design.

My only negatives are that there are way too many straps, first thing I did was undo several straps and I plan on cutting another one off, geesh what is up with all the straps? Anyhow they are easily removed so not a deal breaker. The other thing is that the beige khaki color is a little dark compared to the picture (and yes I had my PC monitor calibrated for color/brightness using a Spyder calibrator), but not a big deal, and I imagine leaving it in the hot sun a few days would bleach out some of the color over time.

It says it's a 1362 cubic inch bag, but it would have helped if they just would have put the dimensions. 1362 cubic inches sounded big, but I was definitely wrong. It expands a pretty decent amount, but that can't compensate for it's smallness. It's pretty good quallity for what is though. If you were looking for a rugged backpack for a child then this would be great for them. It's basically a kid sized outdoor pack. Maybe if it were pictured with something for size reference that would really help. I can't even begin to describe how dissapointed I was when I opened the box.So if you're looking at buying this bag, stop and think for a minute.

I ordered Olive Drab, because I wanted a muted color that looked worn/used fairly quickly, for travel security. Instead, I got a deep olive, a green/brown, which will never be close to the color shown in the photos shown on Amazon, or in other places. I assume ordering Black might mean a deep gray, or a stark black.  For someone trying to be as low key as possible, the deep colors are a detractor.  That said, it LOOKS like a great bag for $45-50, and once the straps are adjusted, it fits fine for me, a 5 ft 8 person at about 200 lbs. If you're going to load it at 10-25 lbs, it'll work fine.

That Dakine was awesome, but I didn't want to spend $80+ on a new one, so I got this thing. I really dig it for what it is. It is relatively small in profile, but it easily fits my huge laptop and a couple textbooks and notebook and power chord, along with a bunch of pens and a flashlight and other junk in the upper pouch. I have used it for foreign travel a couple times and it is great for that too. Laptop, iPad, maps, notebook, etc...holds them all and cinches down to keep anything from shaking around inside the pack. All pouches are full-zip, which is great because you can just open the whole pack like a book to get to stuff without having to rummage around and disturb everything just to find whatever you're looking for that has fallen to the bottom of the bag. I also love how compact it looks and fits.HOWEVER, while this thing is covered in MOLLE and has a tactical look, I would not use it for that purpose. If you're looking for a middle or long range hiking/tactical/survival pack, look elsewhere and pay a bit more. This thing isn't big enough for those uses, in my opinion, and the build quality is so-so. I have hauled it around town and onto airplanes and to school everyday, etc, but I HAVEN'T abused it like you would if you were banging around in a combat/survival scenario. That said, through routine but light use, it has fraying threads and all kinds of other little stuff wrong with it already. I fully expect it to hold up as a serviceable all-round light-use pack for the next couple years, but feel pretty confident in saying that heavier uses would probably kill this thing pretty fast."

Great value, nice pack.","Value:  After reviewing a fair amount of packs, I finally chose the Condor.  Glad I did since I am very satisfied with this purchase.  First of all, you gotta love the price.  There wasn't a lot to lose at this price point.  So why not?  There are a lot of other packs to choose from, but some of those were priced 2-8 times the Condor pack.  I wanted to keep this as inexpensive as possible, so for me, it's working out to be a great value.Size:  A lot of other reviews will complain about the lack of room.  If they had paid attention to the measurements, they would have realized this is not an &#34;expedition&#34; pack.  I needed a day to day pack for an ipad, light jacket, small notebook, sunglasses, etc.  This is working out just fine.  If you need to go on a 3+ day camping trip, this is not your pack.  If you're a student carrying a lot of books, this probably isn't your pack.  But if you need a day to day pack, or a range pack, or a small pack to carry on the plane/train... this is perfect.  Keep in mind I am 6'4&#34;, 230 lbs.... I'm a relatively big guy... but it still fits well and is fairly comfortable.Quality:  Seems fine to me... I'm not an expert in these matters but know if I've been ripped off.  Once again the value seems to be there since it has the quality, so I've been pleased.  I've had this for a couple of months and haven't had any issues.  Took this on flights, use it day to day for work... so far, so good.  I like the many different compartments with different sizes.... keeps things very organized and easy to get to.  No problems so far with zippers, buckles, or straps.  My only &#34;negative&#34; comment - I was a little surprised by the color... I went with the coyote tan and it appears to have a little more green in the color than what I was expecting.  I would call it a dark-earthy tan... Not a big deal since I didn't buy this for style points!Summary:  Overall, I think most people would agree that the price is great for what you are receiving.  Nothing but good things to say here.  I would definitely buy this again."

I will correct their oversight by stating this bag is modular and the straps are no different. You can actually replace the straps remove them completely whatever you wish but with that you have to adjust everything on this bag. What people need to do is after setting it to your desired liking you NEED to run the straps back through the adjusting buckle this will ensure the strap will not adjust or disengage (I cut my straps so they were not too long).I like that you can adjust where the padded straps sit which can make all the difference where the bag sits on your back. I like mine sitting high which this bag let me accomplish. The zippers are very durable and big offering the locking tabs to lock and make opening easier. There are 5 compartments including the bladder. You won;t regret this purchase as it offers bang for the buck. I would consider this a 24 hour pack."

Most other packs were too big. I highly recommend you go on youtube and look up this pack so you can get an accurate idea of the size. It's quite compact. (Perfect!)My only beef is the straps. If they could have made them just a bit nicer (better attachment, much better padding)I would have given this pack 5 stars. However, I realize I didn't pay a premium price for it so I guess some compromise is needed somewhere.I ordered the OD green pack, which is a great color. As a bonus for some reason Amazon has that particular color marked down lower than the other colors.And one last FYI, if you are a bit 'well padded' you won't get the hip strap around you.

When it arrived I thought it was pretty small, but after packing and unpacking it a few times I can actually get quite a bit of gear in here.Makes a great overnight bag, or short camping trips. It is slightly too small to be a bug out bag (in my opinion). It would be great for that if it had just a tiny bit more space, but I will leave that up to you. Can hold a 102 oz hydration bladder (mine is a Source bladder), but not if it has a cover (such as a Camelbak hotshot). I have a Source tactical hydration pack, and it will only fit if I remove the bladder from the outer shell.The only reason this doesn't get five stars is that the padding sometimes misses where my shoulders come in contact with the straps.

The bottom pocket on the front neatly organizes various items and the smallest pocket holds pens, flash drives, ect. Also, every pocket except the smallest one has another internal pocket.The pocket closest to your body houses a hydration bladder however I don't recommend using it. The shoulder straps are hard to understand but with some tinkering, they are quite comfortable. The fabric and stitching is made of 600 denier fabric which is very durable an the stitching itself is nice although there are a few loose ends that need to be cut.

I removed the chest and waist belts, just because I wouldn't need them, but it's great to have that option.The zippers are very sturdy and the stitching for the most part is good. I did find that on both shoulder straps that there was a big thread loose in the same place on both straps - I just snipped it off and kept going.I would recommend that the shoulder strap padding is secured tighter to the straps, as they kept flipping over when putting on.The compression straps are great! I like how small or how big this thing can get. I had this on in a significant rain and nothing inside showed any signs of moisture.I would recommend this bag to anyone."

Regardless, it's been great as my every day bag. I generally haul around a sketch book, 15&#34; Macbook, lunchbox, and a slew of pens and electronics peripherals. The construction is durable. More or less comparable to similarly sized Drago products (for a better price) and worth the extra dollars over the not as well put together NCStar VISM products.PROS- Straps are adjustable where they meet the top of the bag AND at the bottom (incl. rapid unsnap)- Strap chest and waist stabilizers. Chest are removable/movable- Main pocket opens to bottom- MOLLE spacing standard- Each pocket has multiple internal organization- Durable enough for sustained normal wear and tear- Large (if not over-sized, unfortunately) quality zippers- Accepts camel pack.CONS- The shoulder straps connect at the top via 1 inch wide strap section. While it's durable enough, the straps tend to twist when putting it on. Just a consideration.- Mesh inside main compartment is only big enough for, stay, a stack of papers, rather than folders or anything larger.- Strap padding is good, but only really functions with a light to medium load (10-20lbs). With that said, the total weight capacity of the pack itself is still much higher - this is merely a comfort concern.If the relatively small capacity doesn't bother you, this pack is surprisingly durable, capable and versatile."

It is NOT a regular size backpack, check the dimension and be sure you know what you are looking at. That said, I took my measurements and it was the perfect size - when it arrived, it was indeed exactly the perfect size for what I was looking for. The MOLLE/PALS webbing is really nice for add-ons.There are a ton of straps, waist, chest, shoulders, expanding straps, PALS straps, etc. The padded waist straps allow you to fill this thing with a lot of weight and keep that weight on your hips instead of shoulders - like a hiking bag. If you know how to adjust the straps there is no reason for this bag to be uncomfortable. Using it for a range bag, loading it up with towel in main compartment on top of a few hundred rounds of ammo and target stickers in the main compartment's internal sleeve. Secondary compartment contains cleaning kit, masking tape, more targets on internal sleeve. Top outer compartment is just big enough for Mossy Oak  Okolona Ear Muffs (that are pretty sweet by the way). Lower outer compartment contains pics, brushes, allen wrenches, screwdrivers, etc. Attached a multi-tool to the webbing and plan on putting some mag pouches and maybe more. It is really nice construction quality.Zero complaints - just remember to check the dimensions and be sure this is big enough. (I think most negative reviews have to do with the size)"

No way is it cheap but only if you can fit what you want to fit in there.When I first received this bag, all I can say was that it was tiny. I only intend to use this as a everyday/camera bag for my Nikon D600 with a 60mm lens and a 100mm. But none of the compartments can fit it well unless it is snug in there and with no padding, I wouldnt want my camera in there.

On the shoulder straps themselves, the stitching was uneven and looks really bad in many different places. The stitching is also coming apart all over (the shoulder straps and the main bag). The adjustment straps on the shoulder straps never stay where you place them. Once you slide your arm through and sling it over, the immediately loosen to the max. Very frustrating. What really got me was the MOLLE webbing on the front pocket. None of the loops were even. Some loops on the molle were so tight, I could barely slide a chem light through it. Again, very poor construction. As far as the compartments go, they really do not hold a lot of stuff. Hopefully this time my review gets posted!"

"646","XX","B0038MV0BU","5.0","January 22, 2013","A1SA31F6FE4L52","A little smaller than I hoped","I have had terrible luck with backpacks ever since I was little. For some reason, no matter how much I spend, the bottom rips out completely, leaving me with textbooks and paper all over the ground, or the seams around the zippers rip open. When my most recent bag did this I finally gave up and started looking for something that was built for a little more than carrying textbooks. This arrived in manageable packaging and was completely fine out of the box. My Tuesday/Thursday classes require that I carry a substantial amount of material into the bag, and though it's a tight (uncomfortably so) fit, three notebooks, a large textbook, and a small textbook all fit in to the main compartment. The beauty of the way this is made is that even with a main compartment that is completely stuffed, the outer pockets are still just as roomy and maintain capacity.I also noticed that the weight feels substantially less in this bag than my previous bag, even with the same amount of material and a heavier fabric. Not sure if that's because of the way the straps are padded/attached or what, but it's definitely a welcome surprise. There are plenty of adjustment points and compression straps to customize the pack to exactly the shape and size you prefer, which is excellent.Though the main compartment is a bit small (depth wise), I am completely in love with this pack. It doesn't look like it will fall apart any time soon, either.As an added bonus, I get to feel like I'm supporting our military every time I leave the house with it. Gotta love that."

It was great for urban sight seeing and (barely) held my .5 liter Platypus bottle or a 16oz water/soda bottle, with a granola bar, small camera, pocket tour book and maybe a few other small things.  It was a great bag, but eventually went missing so I ordered the digital camo to replace it.  The new bag zippers are shorter, and makes it impossible to fit those bottles, and the back pocket doesn't fit the size documents (maps etc) that the old one did.  I also have recently purchased the larger bag, which is almost twice the volume of the old bag, but that makes it better for hiking and carrying two bottles with other stuff.  However, the sewing quality is aweful.  the back zipper had no end stop, so it just came right off the first time I tried to put a map in it.  Plus the stitching on the front pocket missed some of the fabric, leaving a small hole on the side.  On both bags, the belt is long enough for my 42in waist with room to spare.  The internal main pocket volume is more wedge shaped (wide at the top and tapering at the bottom).  This restricts the volue capacity a bit, but also has the positive affect of keeping the contents more snug against your body, minimizing 'flopping' and not snagging on jackets, or doorways.  It is more comfortable than the more squarish type of fanny packs."

I've been pretty pleased with all of them, and this one is no exception.  I do it's important to discuss how small the knife actually is, though.I read the reviews and looked at the pictures and specs and decided to give this knife a shot mostly because I wanted to something to carry in my dress pants to work.  A folder on the belt or a multi-tool was out of the question because weapons/knives of any kind are frowned upon at my office if they can be seen.  That being said virtually every multi-tool and the majority of folding knives produce a very unsightly bulge if carried in the front pocket of some Docker's.  I also didn't want to carry one in my back pocket and sit on it all day.This knife you can't even tell it's in your pocket by sight or by feel.  That's great.  The possible negative is that the knife is about the size of my index finger in width and length.  The depth is less than three quarters stacked.  Now, while I feel like this knife is just a little too small, it has come in handy many times.  It ships fairly sharp and is made of good quality steel.To summarize, this is a pretty good knife if you come in knowing how very small it is.  If that's not a problem for you, or that's exactly what you, you may find this to be a 4 or 5 star blade.  I was surprised at how small it was, so i took a star or so off.  As previously mentioned, I did keep the knife and do use it, so if a 3.5 star rating were possible I would go with that.I would recommend this to someone who wanted something small."

This is a compact and strong little knife. As mentioned in other reviews, I'm also constantly detangling coins and/or keys from the open spine of the Gerber 22-41122 STL 2.0, Fine Edge Knife. It's black finish wears off rather quickly but that's not a major concern to me. The knife is easy to open with one hand but it does take some practice. The blade lock securely and positively holds the open blade in position so that the knife doesn't close on your hand while its in use.The only issue I've experienced with this knife that I haven't already seen mentioned by other reviewers, is that the blade is held in place by a retaining stud with a countersunk retaining nut which screws into place. That in itself is not the problem. When the knife gets a little wear and tear on it, the retaining nut begins to work loose from the stud. It's easy to retighten but the hex key wrench required for the job isn't easy to find, so I usually just run it down finger tight and that works.

Would not EDC it.","I bought this little guy to stick in my boot pocket in case I need it in an emergency and other knives are not available to me. For that purpose I find it to be a decent knife, however, I wouldn't want this to be my only knife, but it really depends on your needs and expectations I suppose.Personally I prefer to carry a small fixed blade knife on me at all times (usually an ESEE Izula) as I'm in the military and use them often and usually I'm not easy on them. Fixed blades have no moving parts so there's nothing to fail unless the steel just flat out breaks.When I'm not able to carry a fixed blade knife I prefer a folder with more size than this little Gerber offers. I carry a Benchmade mini-griptilian for that purpose, but there are many knives that are cheaper that will fit the bill. Gerber has plenty to offer as well.As for this little Gerber knife, the construction seems decent enough. It came fairly sharp, though I've had some come much sharper. I sharpened it myself a good bit more.Opening the blade is a two handed process. There's no way to open it with just your thumb, at least not reasonably. Closing the blade is also a two handed process.So the conclusion. As a concealable back up knife, this is great for the price. As a primary EDC, no way. But my way of thinking may differ from yours so evaluate your expectations in a knife and go from there."

With a low-profile body and black coating, it makes the knife extremely versatile, whatever you're wearing. The thickness of the overall knife is about 4-5 credit cards, but maintains a very strong, positive lock without any play or bending. The knife came with and has maintained a very sharp edge, with no damage to the black finish so far. As stated by other reviews, the knife does not have a proper thumb screw, so opening the blade can be quite difficult. However, this knife is meant to be a small, handy blade, not a tactical folder.Overall, the build quality is exceptional, and is one of the best knife deals by Gerber."

My kids said the same thing...What it is, is nicely sharp, 440 blade, super slim. It seems a bit flimsy, but this is a small fine cutter, and works great if you want something very unobtrusive to carry around. (Time will tell if it holds up as well as my LSTs, my at-hand small utility cutters which I've had for decades.)Two complaints: The frame lock does this odd 'step' thing where it slides part-way over when the blade opens, but then all the way over to the opposite scale as soon as you grip hard. It's a strong lockup, but really hard to undo as the lock is flush with the scales--needs two hands. I risked removing a bit of steel from the non-lock scale to partially expose the lock, and it works better now.Second: the cut-out in the blade is small, sits very close to the scales when closed, and is very sharp-edged. (When I bought it, I noticed whitish flakes in the hole that I quickly realized were handy DNA samples from anyone else that handled it--it shaves bits off your nails.) Very hard to open one-handed (and bad on the manicure if you care about such things). I may do some polishing here in the future if it continues to bother me.Still, it's a cool, useful and cheap little knife with a good fine blade."

The blade slot and liner lock tab are small and thin, and I have pretty good size hands. After a few dozen open/closes and a drop of oil, it has smoothed out nicely though.

The black finish is a nice touch, but it will be interesting to see how it lasts over time. The price was good, for me less than $12 after taxes. I did not realize at the time it does not have a pocket clip, but that was my error in reading the description rather than a flaw in the knife. It is a little stiff to open for me, it takes two hands rather than a flick of the thumb.

The pivot is a bit stiff, but I'm sure that will loosen up with time and use (I did put a drop of machine oil into it and it smoothed out some). The framelock is VERY positive, but is a bit difficult to disengage, again due to the Liliputian dimensions of the knife, but you won't have to worry about it accidently closing during use! The 2&#34; blade wasn't as sharp as other Gerber knives, but after a couple passes on a honing stone the thing is razor sharp. The handles are small and a bit slick; I've added a 2&#34; lanyard to mine to give me a bit more to grip while using the knife.

I noticed that some people give me bad vibes since going onto campus (you never know), and especially whenever I'm out late at night walking through alleyways and such(I have characteristics that would appear at first make me &#34;an easy target&#34;)I am no connoisseur, so this will be a basic review.Shape:  I have small hands, so it fits nicely, sometimes hidden in my hand, build feels firm.Appearance:  Slender; Discreet (it hangs on a keychain), can't even tell what it is unless you open it.  However, the finish is easily worn: was next to a brass key and had to move it accordingly;  Dislike logos, but doesn't bother me too much.  There is no clipSharpness:  I honestly can't really tell between similar products, but it does what it does;  had to sharpen it a little to where I was satisfied with its cutting action though.Convenience:  A pain to open, a pain to close.  I don't know if there are similar products that have a better open/close mechanism.Rating 4.0/5  ---- -0.5 for the easily worn finish, -0.5 for the difficulty in opening/closing.  But it is pretty damn cheap.  But it could be perfect, right?PROTIP:  So I mentioned that it was a pain to open, but I figured out a fast draw method (takes practice).  This requires it to be on a keychain.  Take it out of your pocket, put your thumb and index into the little slot, with tip facing down/away from your hand.  With a small radius (no need to throw a baseball pitch) and flick of the wrist, swing the keychain's center of gravity out, and the knife should open by weight of momentum; the handle will also open in the palm of your hand.  You will bust a nail or two, but its either this or fiddle with the darn thing.  I also noticed that for self-defense, you could leave the blade exposed, and swing the keychain a-la ball-and-chain/nunchaku;  Of course, this would require some additional training for effective use in the real world (can hurt yourself obviously), but it does increase the reach distance.  I tried it on the delivery box it came in, and I definitely wouldn't want that swinging near my head.Nice knife, but it does take some ingenuity to make up for what it is worth."

I liked the finish on it, but it is already kinda scratched up. That is not that big of a deal since I bought it as a edc pocket knife to cut boxes, rope, packages, etc... I did not buy it to be a fancy knife. It is solid and locks pretty well. I have been reading a lot of reviews and looking at what makes a good knife. I did the spine test and it did not fold. The downside to that is that it is pretty hard to close when you want to close it. It is definitely not a 1 handed operation. Ok I just tried it and I can kinda sorta open and close it with one hand, but it is not easy. But I am not using this as a self defense weapon. So overall for the money I paid and the fact it is a Gerber I think I got my money's worth. I would have given it 5 stars if the finish would not have scratched up.

Oh well.In the product description, it says that it's possible to open with one hand.  It's not possible to do this safely, the knife is far too small.

Pull it out most of the way, so there is about an inch left coming out the side of the knife. Puff out that end, then use a lighter to melt it thoroughly.

The knife is much sturdier than I thought it would be for something so thin. The LED light is pretty bright. The tweezer is comfortable and easy to use. The toothpick... Well, does anyone actually use the toothpick on a Swiss Army Knife or anything like that? It's just a plastic toothpick like any other. I'm sure it will get a piece of meat out from between your teeth, lol. The whistle is loud, which is what you want in an emergency whistle.I bought this for my dad and am looking forward to giving it to him on Father's Day.

The whistle is loud, a lot louder than expected. It could actually be of use in an emergency. The light can be used as an emergency backup in the event your headlamp or flashlight batteries go dead. Don't know if the tweezers would be of much help removing ticks. They are pretty flimsy. All in all, I would recommend the card tool because it provides an extremely lightweight backup for three of the essential survival tools all backpackers or hikers should always carry with them. Gave it only four out of five stars because it lacks the compass and magnifying glass present on other card tools, but then again it would no longer be a credit card sized tool if they tried to fit all the essentials on it...

So I opened it up an started looking it over.Let's look at the tools:1. Knife- it looks decent enough to use as a letter opener, cutting tape, cutting thin rope, string and such.  As far as a spear head...IDK about that.  But if you are in need of one, well, I guess that it may serve well enough.2. LED light- It is red and it works for now.3. Whistle- Thin and reasonably loud.  Yep, you blow in it and it makes a loud noise.4. Tweezers- I am a bit hesitant of these.  They are thin, like really thin, much like tweezers found on a Swiss Army Knife.  One problem I see with it is that the head on it is plastic, and coud easily break off.  I will probably reinforce this with some superglue.5. Toothpick- It is plastic, but it is hard plasic.  If it was a slightly softer plastic, I think that it would serve its purpose better.6. Firestarter- It sparks. I think that it kinda wimpy, but I am accustomed to FireSteel firestarters from the website by the same name.7. ???  On the package and on this website it mentions inch/cm rulers.  Nope, not there. On the package it also mentions a lanyard hole.  Is this the 7th tool?  Can you really count a hole as a tool.  Dig a hole in the ground and it becomes a tool?  Umm, nope.  There is no 7th tool.But otherwise I think that is is handy enough, and I can deal with 6 semi-decent tools in something that is so compact."

Lets face it, If I'm a operator of some sort or going camping, hiking, climbing, etc... in the wilderness I'm not going to rely on this at all, even as a backup. This is better intended for use in civilization where I generally don't walk around with a 30+ lbs rucksack. I think the problem was Tool Logic ran a little too far with the Tacticool appeal. That said it isn't too bad if you 'juryrig' it a little.The red lens flashlight sucks but it uses 3mm LED bulbs which can be obtained for about 75 cents (give or take). If you get a 3mm white bulb and shape the leads to resemble the stock with pliers and wire cutters, and then replace the red bulb it actually becomes a pretty decent little light. Lets face it your never going to be using a credit card flash light in a situation where you would need to keep from giving away your position.I haven't used the magnesium firestarter, but like the red bulb I can't see a reason I would use on in my daily life. Especially since I'm a dirty nasty smoker and generally have a bic on me anyway. However, its pretty easy to pry it off of its holder and (using a dremel like tool)cut down a honing rod to replace it. Now you have a nice wallet pocket knife sharpener.The tweezers and tooth pick...are tweezers and toothpicks, I don't know how else to rate them. They seem to work well enough. I keep a little Leatherman on my keys which is a great alternative to a Swiss Army knife, but lacks those two items. So I appreciate having them them.The Whistle is actually pretty loud. Maybe I'm a bit paranoid as a firefighter-paramedic and prior service Marine, but this is one thing I don't mind having just in case even in my day to day schedule. You never know when you might be trapped in a burning building, or get stuck under something heavy and its a good thing to have in order to call for help. Its louder and carries further than your voice, plus it won't go horse. Will you ever need it? Probably not, but its a good thing to have just in case.I can't rate the knife, I already carry a Spyderco Delica on a daily basis and hate redundancy, so just as I ground the previously stated Leatherman blade into a saw, I tossed the knife the moment I got the package and carry folded up a few pieces of paper and a small wallet pen in its place. So that doesn't factor into my rating.Like I said, if you don't mind doing a bit of Jury Rigging it makes a decent little thing to carry in your wallet. The only other thing I would advise potential buyers on is that it is closer to the size of 3 stacked credit cards rather than a single one as advertised."

"923","XX","B000VW7E4M","4.0","July 14, 2012","AARHLUIV2NNI2","High Quality Pocket Knife, Good Price","I wanted to get something better than the usual cheap swiss army type pocket knife and found this much better.  The blade is tougher.  It locks into place so securely that it will not accidentally close on your hand (which happened to me once with the cheaper folding pocket blades that do not have a real locking mechanism).  The metal that it is made from feels very high quality and it comes very sharp.  I imagine that long term daily use would require it to be sharpened often, but I wanted it for emergencies that occasionally pop up and the blade has not dulled yet.  There are two nobs that are meant to assist opening the knife with one hand.  While it is possible, it feels a little hard and a little slow to do so.  There is another mechanism that mildly locks the knife into a closed position and resists opening up easily for good reasons.  Once the grip of this lock is released, however, the nobs seem to assist completing the opening movement very well.  I find I can open the knife with one hand by first pinching the middle back of the blade with my thumb and two fingers, and then use the nobs to complete the movement.  The locking mechanism in the open position requires that one push a metal mechanism away from the blade closing path by hand.  It is well designed to prevent accidental closure and really needs both hands to close it.  The blade is light weight.  It is bigger than the usual swiss style pocket knife, but still fits well in a pocket.  Because it is light weight, you can forget that you have it in your pocket.  The grip feels very firm when the blade is opened.  It feels like an ideal compromise between size and comfort.  It is small enough to be a pocket knife and big enough to allow a comfortable grip (at least for my hands, I can imagine larger hands not feeling this, mine are about medium).All in all, I like the knife and picked it over a large number while at a store, testing each for their pros and cons.  After a few weeks having it, I do not regret my decision.  I especially like how firm it locks in to place, how easily it unlocks, and how firm it stays closed.  The main reservation is that thumb nobs for opening the knife do not work easily.  But I am still happy that they are there, because it is at least possible to open it with one hand.  In some possible emergency senarios, this may be very important."

I will say that after 2 years of being truly beaten on, the blade has developed a significant wobble, but periodic tightening seems to fix that up.

After just 1 night in the bushes of Northern Arizona it looked kinda rugged. Anyway after the end of my trip I threw it away, not because it was too damaged, but because it didn't fit for carry-on baggage on the plane. It can be an advantage too: you won't regret throwing away a 10$ thing.Good choice if you are just going camping with a car."

But sleeping on this mat is much better than sleeping on the ground. It is very light-weight, rolls up easily and the elastic bands are great for holding it together when it's rolled up. I cut it a little bit (just using a scissors) to make it a bit narrower and shorter because I'm not a very big person and this makes it even smaller to transport.Scratches do show up fairly easily but I didn't expect the pad to be indestructible and it's nothing that affects the effectiveness of the pad. Also, the low price of the mat means that if it is in rough shape after my travels around West Africa I won't be out too much money when I throw it out. Overall I am very satisfied!"

I've only used it on one weekend thus far and as other people have said it does tear easily. Another thing I noticed is it conforms to the contour of the ground a little too well; instead of leveling out the ground and giving you a smoother sleeping surface it simply took the edge off any small rocks or sticks you may not have gotten clear out. What I'm getting at is the next morning when I woke up the pad was essentially molded to the ground, when I picked it up you could still see every bit of the ground's texture within the mat. Next time, unless I buy a high end pad, I'll probably just buy a military surplus standard issue sleeping pad. I've used them plenty of times before and I'd much rather sleep on it.All in all this is a nice pad for its low cost though."

The advertised photo makes it look like a higher quality pad than it actually is.I only added it to my cart to get a $20 discount, so it wasn't a loss for me.

I usually love to shop at Amazon, but while I was researching if this is the same pad we already have (IT'S NOT-- THIS IS ONLY 3/8 OF AN INCH THICK), I saw it on the Coleman site for $9.99.  Was surprised to find a lower price.  SO-- While I DON'T HAVE THIS PAD-- I gave it 2 stars-- based on  getting it cheaper somewhere else, and believing that our pad-- which is nearly an inch thick-- is GREAT-- and 3/8 of an inch must really leave something to be desired!  I guess if you are a hiker and are space-conscious, it's better than nothing-- but if a few more inches when rolled up doesn't cause you inconvenience, I would look for the thicker pad!"

We got this to use as an isolation mat, not for its cushioning, and it does that job exceptionally well.  It's wide enough to easily fit a 'thick' adult on it, from shin to head (I am 5'10') and keep the ground from sucking all the heat out of you.  The bottom side of me was the warmest side of me while laying on this mat, and that was in 35* nights, so I would guess that even at cooler temperatures it would do a good job of insulating your body from the cold ground.For the price, it can't be beat for its insulating properties, but if you are looking for a 'feather bed' affect, this isn't the mat for you."
