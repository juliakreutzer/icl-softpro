The bracket that holds the blade assembly to the frame had a sharp corner and the handle could not move up into the neutral position so the belt could not release.  I almost totally disassembled the unit (even removed the motor) to get to the bolts and nuts.  Removed the bracket and used my grinder to remove about 3/8 inch off the sharp edge or corner, bought some washers for spacers to allow the tube to operate full range.  Put it all back together, filled it with oil and gas and it started, ran and operated perfectly.  They are so much better than a stick edger.  A friend of mine taught me how to adjust the angle of the blade to cut around trees to create a border and mulch bed.  The Briggs engine starts with one pull and the unit is easy to push and operate.

This thing was throwing snow like my 5 hp gas blower. After about 5 or 6 uses I had to tighten up all the bolts on the handles because they started to loosen up. We had one storm with 27' of snow and I had to chop the snow down in front of it but it throws the snow more than 20' (today I measured a couple of times snow landing over 50' in front of the machine)! We just went through a blizzard with over 38' and drifts over 6' high. It took a while but I cleaned up the mess with a now 3 year old machine. The only problem I've had was the on off switch shorted out after 3 years. A quick trip to the hardware store and a little rewiring got me up and running in less than an hour. I would have called and ordered a new switch but the warranty is over and I needed to move the mountains of snow. For the money you can't go wrong.

Shame on you Snow Joe.*****EDIT:  Make sure you check the blade bolts OFTEN!  I used my blower 4 or 5 times and while using it one of the bolts fell out and the blade spun around inside the housing and punched a hole through it.*****I bought this snow blower after we were hit with 24 inches of snow a week or so ago.  Assembly was a piece of cake right out of the box.  Overall it is very lightweight and as my neighbor said, 'My wife could even do this.'.  Since I had already shoveled my driveway and sidewalk I decided to tackle the plow chunks.  I don't think it is really meant to tackle packed chunks of icy snow but it did manage to slowly chew through it.  My main concern before purchase was that it might now have the power to throw the snow but it definitely does.  While clearing my neighbor's sidewalk chunks of ice were hitting his house... oops.  I always forget that electric motors have a constant torque lines unlike gas engines.  I think this could handle up to 12 inches of snow in one pass as long as you don't force it.Now I'm just waiting for more snow so I can really put it through its paces.  The manual recommends at least a 14ga extension cord but I use a 10ga.  I think keeping the voltage from dropping will keep the torque of the electric motor up.I deducted a star for 3 minor reasons.  One, the wheels are plastic and I'm worried about how well they will hold up.  Two, the handle assembles easily but it would be nice to be able to break it down quickly and throw it in the trunk of your car.  Three, the cord does not stay plugged in securely.  Even though the extension cord is wrapped around the handle and plugged in, it still vibrates loose.  I small latch would solve this.For the price I'm very happy with it.  Bring on the snow."

First I cleared my parents driveway and walk, then my neighbors, then loaned it to a second neighbor who used it to clear her driveway, then the next day I used it to clear my driveway and walk. On the high snow you have to angle it upward and take off the top and then take off the bottom. When going down a row of high snow (12' or more) you have to take 1/3 to 1/2 of the width of the snowblowers capacity or you bog it down. For a blizzard it did an awesome job. It took a bit of work to push it into all that snow, but then again this was well beyond it's intended capacity and it did not break or break down. If I were older or less physically inclined, I would have wanted a 2 stage gas snowblower, but for now am quite happy with this little 37lb machine.Updated 2/25/2010Used it a total of 5 times. On the 4th time I ran over an extention cord outside my house for the Christmas lights and the housing of the snowblower got a huge crack down the middle of the unit. The last time I used it I must have picked up something in the driveway which then broke the snow chute broke off. I still say it is a useful lightweight machine; HOWEVER, it really is not built to last. IT IS 100% PLASTIC other than the snow blades. The issue is that once the snow falls you have no idea if there is any debris in your driveway or walkway. As such you are always prone to hit something. And if you hitsomething once, there is a good chance something on the unit will break. I can't image the Toro would be any better, but I may try that next, if only for the lightweight and convenience of being able to lift it into my car myself."

After doing some research, I came across the Snow Joe 622u.  For the price, I couldn't resist reading about it.  One of the reviews was so detailed and explained exactly what its good at and the only problem is watching the cord.  Yes that can be a pain, but after about 10 minutes you will have come up with something that works for you.I used it last year for a few snowfalls that were around 6' each and never had a problem.  This is my second winter with it and I couldn't believe what I forced this machine to do and how it never quit or let me down.  This past Friday night, we started to get a heavy snowstorm and when all was said and done, I think we accumulated between 2-3 ft.  Now, I was out in the drive way about three times on Saturday and once on Sunday morning and it got my driveway clear down to the cement.  I even used it to bust down some snow drifts that were 3-4 ft high by working it in on, titled up, to break it down and make clearing it our a lot easier.  Anyone that lives on the east coast is aware of the massive snowfall we had this weekend and how much work it was to clear it out.  This little machine is a workhorse.

End of the driveway needs to be done in stages, slowly feeding the machine with an amount it can deal with, use your snow shovel to make that pile manageable.Electric engines have their pro's and con's.

It costs less than a 2 stage gas machine but is lighter to deal with.If you expect this to function at the same level of a 2 stage 4 cycle gas powered snow blower here is a news flash, there is no Santa Claus.If you take your time, manage how much you attempt to blow in a single pass and manage the shoot for the direction, this machine will serve your purposes the majority of the time.  You will need to keep a broom handle available to clean out the shoot passageway when the snow is very wet but more times than not that will not be necessary.I replaced my single stage gas thrower with this and it functioned as well as that, with the only difference of managing the cord.

Attach cord, push the interlock button, pull the handle - nothing. Use a tracer (ticker) and find out that the master switch at the handle isn't switching. Take that apart. Snap it 10-15 times and now it seems to work, but the blade still won't turn. Trace wire down into rear housing, remove housing again. More tracing. The motor has a thermal limiter mounted to it that protects the motor from overheating. One crimped on terminal isn't crimped. I solder the wire to the terminal. Leave rear cover off (for testing, - I learned), plug it in, pull the trigger and we have motion. Seems okay.In the snow the best I could do is with about 5-6 inches of moderately heavy snow. Discharge about 10 feet if the angle of the discharge nozzle is roughly straight ahead. I have to go over the area at least twice because nearly as much snow is thrown out the front of the machine as goes out the shoot. The discharge nozzle clogs frequently. If I try to take a full width path of snow, it is too much for the machine. In a heavier (10') snow I had to take no more than 2-3 inches of width or the machine bogs down and the belt starts slipping.After a couple of weeks between storms, I get it out again to try once more. Turn it on and a crackling (electric arcing) is heard. Take off side cover, brush is stuck. Remove rear housing (I'm getting pretty good at taking it off) unstick brush, clean up commutator, reassemble and have basically the same issues as before. Poor performance.BTW - I use a very heavy (12 gauge) extension cord, so plenty of amps are getting to the machine.I had similar problems 2 more times before I got fed up. It was end of season discounts time at local big box store, and I bought a Toro 2 stroke. I had the opportunity to use it on the last snow storm of the season. What a difference! I was throwing the snow the full distance of my driveway (about 30 feet). No, or little discharge from the front. Clogging of the nozzle is much less.In the final analysis, I would suggest you look elsewhere unless you have minimal snow fall. Be sure to use a minimum 14 ga extension cord (12 would be better). Don't expect too much and perhaps you'll be doing okay. If you need assistance from SnoJoe = = don't hold your breath."

The specs say it moves 800 pounds of snow a minute and can throw it 20 feet. That's not how mine performs. If it throws powdery snow 3 feet, that would be a good day. We just had 5 inches of powdery snow last night and I finally gave up and just shoveled it. Because it hardly throws the snow any distance at all, you wind up dumping snow on areas you have already cleared and having to go back over them again and again. If the snow is even the littlest bit moist, it barely throws it a foot and smells like burning rubber (probably the belt) while you use it. There is no way this moves 800 pounds of snow a minute. The chute that you can move around to direct the snow needs work. You can point the chute that directs the tossed snow in a general direction, but if you try to point it downward at all  or even straight off to the side, as soon as the snow starts coming out, it pushes the chute straight back up in the air, and this probably has a lot to do with why it doesn't throw the snow very far. There are a couple of locking wheels you can tighten when you adjust the angle of the chute, but even if you really tighten them down, they loosen up almost immediately. I live in a townhouse and have a short driveway (about 25 feet), so this seemed the perfect solution. Every time I pull this machine out, I am disappointed all over again. There is no way you can use this to move the snow at the curb that the plows toss up, even if you break it down into small piles with a shovel first. The machine squeals and smells like buring rubber. I gave away a smaller electric Toro when I got this, and I'm sorry that I did. It was a much better machine. Save youself the money and don't buy this product."

I do not believe I have ever been this disappointed in a product before.As I first used this snow blower on a few inches of snow I was disappointed to find that it did not work any better than my shovel except for saving my back a little.  The Snow Joe would only throw the snow about 7 feet, give or take.  Once I cleared the first 7 feet of my driveway then my snow depth would double until the next 7 feet where it would double again - and on and on.  I went out and bought a 12 gauge extension cord.  That helped a little bit in throwing the snow about 10 feet.  As I pushed through the snow some of the snow would just get pushed to the side of the Snow Joe causing me to have to go back over the row that I had just cleared - doubling my work.  In total it took me about the same amount of time to shovel my driveway as snow blowing it.We had our first big storm on December 26th.  It was about a foot and a half.  I was very careful with the Snow Joe.  I would clear the top layer of snow by angling the Snow Joe up and then clear the bottom half - again it would push some of the snow to the side.  After clearing a 5 foot area my Snow Joe broke.  The blade would no longer spin.  I had only used the Snow Joe 4 times.  I tried to call the company, but after working my way through their phone menu I would get hung up on.  I tried several different routes through the phone menu, but each time that I would get to the point where I could speak to someone I was hung up on.Since I bought the product at the beginning of spring of last year I cannot return it.  I have a two year warranty, but that seems like a waste sine the Snow Joe is of really no help.Sorry to be such a downer about this product, but I do not want anyone else to make the same mistake that I have made.

My girlfriend needed a small snowblower for her side walks and double wide concrete drive, because of the hassles of starting and maintaining a gas snowblower (and her limited mechanical knowledge) we decided on an electric snowblower. (She handles a vacuum cleaner with a long cord....this seemed no different). We read the reviews on the Toro and Snow Joe and decided on the Snow Joe because of the better quality wheels, easier to reach chute handle and bigger motor (plus it was cheaper). She put it together herself (except for the difficult to tighten small screws on the chute handle). I had to play for awhile to figure out how to start it?...you need to hold in the side start button while you pull back on the handle to start the machine. (not real clear in the directions).....The first night we had 4' of fresh snow and it moved all the snow as easy as vacuuming, right down to the concrete...(it really only throws average snow 5'-10'). There was some old snow that was hard packed along the driveway and the drive belt kept squealing each time I plowed into the old snow.....we salted the remaining hard snow on the driveway (packed from driving on it) and tried clearing the wet snow the next night....and this machine did not like it at all! The drive belt squealed ALOT!.....(also note that NO snowblower of any size likes wet snow....no small gas powered snowblower I have ever used likes wet snow either)...so we had to hand shovel that stuff.....Lesson learned is: GET AT THE SNOW WHILE ITS SNOWING..don't wait to try to clear it after it has hardened or becomes slushy... and make sure you move the snow that the snowplow pushes in at the end of the driveway RIGHT AWAY...this machine does not like HARD PACK...(that snow left from the snowplow that has salt and sand in it). But in my experience this is a very well built and easy to use snowblower for handling fresh dry snow. In 15 minutes I did what used to take 2 hours hand shoveling.UPDATE: 01/01/2008 (Try spraying the plastic behind the Blades and the inside of the chute with a vinyl/plastic protectant such as 'Armor All'..this slick spray keeps the snow from sticking and helps the snow throw farther, plus it keeps the unit looking shiny and new). A winding garden hose real made winding up the cord much easier each time."

I have never had one, so I can't really compare, but we had a record snow on Christmas day and it did the job nicely.  It saves time once you get used to it, but most importantly, it saves your back! I like the smaller open front w/curved casing- safer and no overload.  I didn't have any big problems with snow-throwing distance, either, and I have a big, sloping driveway in Colorado! The Toro review says it throws snow 20', and this does not- more like 6' to 8', but for the extra $100, it's not that important to me with my property configuration.  My husband really likes it (me, too)! A few hints- assembly was easy except for the little screws that you connect the chute director with- have a small plier and short-handled philips head screwdriver ready.  Also, to start, it says press power button then squeeze handle- a little misleading- needs to be almost simultaneous, starting w/button.

It does clear down to the sidewalk but it doesn't throw the snow very far at all. 1st I had to make a second pass just to clear the snow that was thrown to the other side of the sidewalk because of the weak discharge. 2nd the discharge chute consistently clogs up, I had to stop and clear the chute over a dozen times. 3rd the 'so called 4 steel blades' is a little misleading, they're 4 rubber blades secured to 4 steel blades. This item is good for powder snow only 2 INCHES OR LESS it just doesn't have enough power to throw the wet or deep snow.

Each worked in its own way, from the MTD two-stage to my personal favorite, the Craftsman one-stage.Many people see one-stage snow throwers as junk, and I'll agree they have their limitations in heavy or wet snow. But if you get out there right when the snow falls and clear it before it hits ten inches, you'll have a fine time with this little wonder.It does as good a job at snow removal as my Craftsman single did--the two-stage may be a bit more versatile but it's like handling a rototiller and you have to have a place to store it. This baby hangs on a pair of wall hooks in the garage, with the cord hanging next to it.I was amazed at how well this little 'off brand' thrower does its work. I got it to test the proposition that 99% of snow removal can be done with a little tool like this. But it bore me out last year. Neighbor has an Ariens that cost him almost $1400. When he saw my little blower he offered to clear my driveway for me.After clearing my (two-car with turnout space) driveway and hanging up the machine and cord back in the garage, I looked next door. He was still trying to get the beast started.UPDATE MARCH 2010:Well, I had almost three seasons with Snow Joe, but he couldn't handle the double whammy snowstorms of February--gave up the ghost. So I bought the Toro version of the same thing. It handles very similarly to the Snow Joe, but the impeller and chute design is better. I wish the chute crank were easier to reach (liked that about the SJ) but the Toro gets more snow faster than the SJ.I was very close to buying one of Toro's gas Power Curve models, but went with another electric. When the second snowstorm hit, this Toro went through it like butter. I made sure to get out there and clear the first batch before it hit ten inches. Second batch was actually deeper at probably about ten inches, and it was just as easy. The Toro took full-width bites out of the first pass. The deeper pass required me to bump it out 4 inches or so to account for the higher snow volume.But it chewed through it like a champ. I continue to recommend electric snowblowers to homeowners who don't face a huge amount of snow in the winter and don't have more than a hundred feet between their outlet and the street. My 100-foot cord hits the end just as I get to the street. If my driveway were a foot longer I'd have to go with a longer cord.But I am switching my recommendation from Snow Joe to Toro. The Toro throws better, stays clearer, is better put together, and is quieter than the Snow Joe, especially under load.Spend the extra and get the Toro. You won't be sorry."

While wheeling it across my lawn the right rear tire fell off. I looked and saw why. The axle is kept in place by a tiny, thin, c-shaped clip that inserts into a slight groove at the end of the axle. Just wheeling this blower across my lawn was enough 'torque' to cause the clip to spring free and disappear into the lawn. Snow Joe sent me another part and I clipped the axle back on. Three weeks ago I had my first occasion to use the blower in about 2 inches of fresh snow. I got a third of the way done in my standard-size driveway and the axle fell off. Same problem---the clip popped off.I just got off the phone with Amazon and Snow Joe. Amazon can't do anything about it because it was sold by a third-party who has a 30 day return policy. In my opinion, its not the sellers issue anyway---its a manufacturers design flaw and they should step up. I called Snow Joe. They said they can't take it back because I bought it from a third party, but they did offer to send me three more clips. I will try the new clips and see, but I am not expecting anything other than more frustration."

It has never been pushed too hard and appears nearly new as it had only been used a total of 10 hours and only used to remove light to medium powder.Mid last week I was preparing to clean up the edges of my drive after removing the brunt of the snow with an old Craftsmen 8.5.I switched on and the motor ran well for around 30 seconds ( no load ) and started slowing down. I smelled a 'bakelite smoke', checked under the lower housing, switched it on again and observed arcing.I contacted Snow Joe and told the rep the details and that I suspected I need a new motor or at least a set of brushes.She said it was probably the switch and that they would send me one which they did promptly.I replaced the switch and the symptoms persisted - arcing - smoke - reduced power. Called SJ again and talked with a rep ( 10-15 minutes was my typical wait time ). He said they'd ship me a USED motor which they did.In the meanwhile, I disassembled the unit and discovered that the impeller pulley nut had almost fallen off! I removed the bad motor and began disassembling it. The Brushes were 'gone' and the commutator was 'burned' (arcing).I set the rotor up BETWEEN CENTERS on my trusty, ACCURATE, WELL MAINTAINED Olde Logan Lathe and started turning the commutator, removing .001 of copper with each pass. During the process I determined that THE COMMUTATOR WAS ECCENTRIC to the shaft at least .010' as that's how much I had to remove to get bright copper all the way around. It's now turning true at .000'!The bakelite burning smell was the result of the brusholders burning as the brushes were 'reciprocating at least .010 with each revolution of the motor. They were 'worn' to the end of their life and were 'making and breaking' now with each revolution of the motor.I'd have a serviceable motor IF SJ had PARTS ! ! ! I need BRUSHES and BRUSH HOLDERS which I was told they don't supply ! ! !It's hard to understand how stuff like this gets through 'quality control'The MOTOR they sent me WAS USED and was also UNSERVICEABLE as the tail bearing housing is broken as is the bakelite brush holder ! ! ! It WASN'T broken in shipping as the packaging showed no damage and the motor was well protected in bubble wrap which leads me to believe the motor had been damaged before packing!I finally got a response to a form email I sent SJ LAST WEEK totally disregarding the MOTOR PROBLEM.Another issue - the GEAR DRIVE was running DRY as all the grease that had been packed during assembly had been thrown off and was stuck to the inside of the gear case.recommendations for buying an electric snowblower:SERVICEABLE - motor, especially BRUSHES -  gear case ( a fill plug and spec for #90 gear oil would be nice ) - LOCKTITE on parts like the auger / impeller nut etc.I'll be returning this unit to CostCo ASAP for a full refund and am considering a TORO at this time.VERY DISSATISFIED with QUALITY, barely satisfied with service as this is still unresolved"

Then came the Chicago Blizzard of 2011 and half of my driveway was covered with 17' of snow and the other half was sitting with 34' of snow (while the adjoining yard was down to bare grass).  Even though the Snow Joe Ultra is designed to clear snow up to 11' deep, with persistance, it really got the job done. The electric snow blower started easily every time, and the large wheels made it easy to maneuver.  The only minor inconvenience was that when I bumped into snow that I was in the process of clearing, the deep snow kept loosening the elevation adjustment knob and the snow was blowing much farther away than I would have preferred, but we had wind gusts of up to 50 miles/hr, so the area where my snow was blowing was getting other blowing snow as well.  I'm very happy with this purchase and from what I have seen so far, I would highly recommend it.

I'm running the unit from a 20 amp circuit with a 50' 14 gauge cord.  It seems to be plenty powerful.The only down side that I've found so far is the workmanship.  One of the wheels came loose and slid around on the axel that runs from one side of the unit to the other behind the throwing auger.

I took the advice of a previous reviewer and cleared my driveway and side walk several times during the 10' storm, so I did not have to deal with the full depth of snow or with wet snow.  This machine is light weight and can easily handle 4'-6' of dry, fresh snow, throwing it 10'-12' away. It is adverised that it can clear 19' wide, 11' deep snow, but it certainly did not do that for me. At 10' deep I had to clear 4' or 5' at a time, not the full width of the machine. It does not work well with wet or packed snow, and struggles with even 2' of it, throwing it maybe 2' or 3'.  I didn't expect it to be as strong as gas models of similar size when I bought it, so I don't see it as a problem.  I just use my shovel when the snow is too deep or two wet. It may not be the best machine if you get snow averaging more than 6'-10', or if occasional shoveling is not an option, but I believe it is the perfect snow thrower for me."

I have a vacation home in Tahoe where snowfall is quite heavy.  Having looked at the product video, I thought this would be perfect for my driveway.  Unfortunately, if the snow is at all compacted or wet, the blower lugs and slows down.  I've tried different feed rates and angles all to no avail.  This blower is well made but useful only in very light snow conditions.  If you can get out there right after the snow falls, this may work ok, but otherwise you need something with a lot more power to get the job done."

It is electric, so there should be no annual maintenance and no problem with starting when you really need it.The blower mechanism works well enough and blows the snow pretty far.  It can get bogged down in about 8' of snow, but never stops so the motor seems solid.  The problem is that some of the parts are just cheaply made.- It took under a minute for the snow chute to get blasted to pieces from some ice.- The wheels do not stay in place, this also happened with the very first run down the driveway.  They are held in place using c-clips around the axle, and easily slide out of place.  If you plan to use this device then plan to fix this issue.  I would probably put a tube between the wheels to keep the separated.Finally, you will need a high current extension cord so be sure to buy one."

Both of us encountered the same problem.  We both started using the 100 ft. 14 gauge (usually blue) power cords that we had purchased for our electric lawn mowers.  Big mistake!  Both my parent's snow thrower and mine caught on fire where the cord plugs into the snow thrower.  I was able to unplug mine right away and it wasn't damaged.  My parents were not so lucky and had to have theirs replaced.  It works fine when using 16 gauge (usually orange) power cords.  The snow thrower does a good job on light snow if it isn't too deep.  If the snow is coming down hard you will have to plow after a couple inches because it won't work if the snow is too deep.  It also has a hard time with moist slushy snow.  Don't even try using it on the thick stuff that builds up after a snowplow goes down the street.  For the price though, how easily it starts up, and the fact that you never need to buy gas or oil for it, it is a real bargain.  Just be aware of its shortcomings and don't expect it to be able to compete with a good gas snow thrower that cost several times more money.12/23/2010 Update:After almost exactly 3 years and 1 month after I purchased the Snow Joe it has now stopped working.  I now don't think it started on fire because of the gauge of the power cord I was using but because of the amperage.  I think the blue power cords we have are 15 amps and the orange ones are 10 amps, but the Snow Joe is only rated for 13 amps.  I'm thinking of getting a new snow thrower now, but I think this time I will try the Toro 1800."

It really did the job well. On the two recent snow storms in NJ, it worked great and save me $$$ on using a professional to remove the snow from my drive-way (150 feet!). Since it snowed like 12 inches each time I had to plow my snow twice (morning and late afternoon). Yes I said 5-6 inches without difficulties, after that, it does work, but you kind of put extra strain on the motor. Keep in mind that it will not work on frozen snow - it's not an ice breaker! and it is harder to throw wet snow and I guess that's the case for any snow thrower. Also, if you drove on your snow covered driveway and then try to remove the snow under your tire tracks with the snow Joe, it will be almost impossible as the snow is too compact! Other than these minor problems it's a great machine.After hearing the few belt problems some of the reviewers reported, I bought an extra one just in case, but didn't need it.I think the snow joe and the toro 1800 are very similar.

I also went to Home Depot and bought a 100 foot extension cord and a 50 foot extension cord.The snow joe is great for what it is.  It is an electric snow thrower-It is not gas and cannot be compared to a gas snow thrower.  I have $800 Toro gas snow blower that  is too much for me to use.  I live 30 minutes form NYC and we get a good amount of snow.  The snow joe loves light an powdery snow.  Heavy wet snow it can handle as long as you respect its limitations.  Before a snow I take a lubricant (ie WD40) and spray the inside of the machine and the chute-this must be done at least the night before as it keeps the machine form getting clogged.  When you are dealing with thick heavy snow you can only use 2/3rd of the width of the machine.  More than that taxes the motor and will probably cause it to overheat an fail.  I also shovel the ends of the driveway, close the the street where the salt gets in the snow.  It makes the snow heavy and it just easier to shovel.  I have a circular driveway with a shoot that goes to the rear garage (approximately 20 cars can fit in my driveway)  It takes about 2 hours to snow joe and shovel the entire driveway.  I use the 100 foot cord to do the majority of the work and then connect the 50 foot cord through a milk crate (so the the ends will never touch the snow- thus eliminate the risk of electrocution)  to finish the job.  this winter has been a very snowy winter in NYC  and my snow joe blows the snow away.  I just plug him in and there he blows.  He is dependable and makes the work much easier.  As long as you understand that he is electric and not gas and use him with those limitations in mind, he will perform well.12/31/2010 UPDATEMy Snow Joe still running strong.  I live 25 minutes form NYC and on 12/26/2010 we had a blizzard.  Snow Joe was put to the test.  We had about 20 inches of snow.  It was not a heavy snow.  It was dry and powdery (but 20 inches of powdery snow is still 20inches) .  It made good snow balls. I took Snow Joe out on Monday and Snow Joe performed. It did really well.  The only negative I can say is that I live on a main road and the two or three feet from the street the snow is nasty and salty. Snow Joe did not like that snow, I just had it cut in a third of the size of the blower.  And Snow Joe worked.  He is still going strong.  The WD40 is a lifesaver-that keeps the snow from sticking.  One annoyance is that for some reason why it is running for a long time one of the screws starts to get loose (IT holds the piece of the handle right next to the motor-I am assuming it tis the vibration. I just bend down every so often and adjust it and it is fine.2/3/2011 UPDATESnow Joe made it through January.  (It did better than Metro North-they lost 1/2 their fleet of trains on my line, but snow joe is still blowing snow).  He rocks.  January 2011 was the month with the second largest snowfall in the NYC area since records have been kept.  February 2010 was number 1 but for less than an inch.  Every week of January 2011 we had snow, ice and snow.  Wet snow, dry snow-any type of snow and we have it.  Snow Joe was a trooper (Still going strong).  Snow Joe blows snow-which is what he is supposed to do.  I love my snow joe and my WD-40-I do not know how I would deal with this snow without them."

Let me say that I live in a townhouse so i have a one car driveway, about 30 feet of sidewalk and about 20 feet of a walkway.  I figured this inexpensive snowblower was perfect for my needs.  Well, I was wrong.  I will say that setup was simple and easy.  It did throw the snow pretty far, but I noticed that the bigger the snow pile the further it went.  When i went through a 3 inch path it went about 3 feet, when i hit a 10-12 inch drift, it went around 20 feet.  The tube from which the snow is thrown is quite cheaply made.  while it has an auger that allows you to direct the snow throwing direction, as the heavier snow goes threw the tube, it continuously pushes the tube back toward the center.  In any case, with all that said, it worked pretty well.  It picked up the snow and moved it which was my main purpose of course.  Just as i was finishing up, I went through one last drift, about 10 inches or so and the tube flew off and the housing had a huge crack.  Now it is useless and I will be returning it."

The FIRST TIME I got it out to clear my driveway, it stops working.  I find that its small belt has stripped.  OK, I order new belts.  I follow the directions in the manual but I cannot get the new small belt back on no matter what I do (including removing the pulley ... then the retaining screw breaks off inside the bearing).  Gee, now I get to order a new pulley too and so spend more money and many hours trying to put the small belt back on again (or let your service people do it so you can make even more money off a badly designed snow blower).  So you seem to be suggesting that I'm supposed to be content with spending $40 for shipping ever time something breaks, esp during the winter when I need a dependable snow blower.  No way.  Would you personally be happy if you had this piece of junk blower?  I think not.  It is clear that this model has serious design issues, but now you're telling me that I've just got to live with it ... your understanding and accommodating attitude is so kind.  The first two fellows I talked with clearly understood what a pain in the rear this design is to repair.  So they offered to let me trade up to an 803 which made me feel a lot better about your company.  Now however I'm really sorry I ever trusted your products.You know, part of what bothers me is that I followed all of the directions offered by YOUR employees.  Now I get to deal with someone considerably less interested in customer satisfaction than the bottom line.  Also, you know well that you could get some money out of my 622 because you offer reconditioned units. After all, it is essentially a BRAND NEW UNIT and should be easy to recondition.  Remember too that your company was paid for the blower by the store that bought it in the first place.So now I get to go around and expound on how little you really care about someone who bought your products.  Remember now, my 622 broke the very first time I used it to clear my driveway ... there's some quality workmanship.  I realize it is possible that I just got a lemon.  But don't you see that I simply cannot trust that model anymore ... who wants to go into winter with a thrower that apparently likes to stop working by chewing up belts that are very hard to replace?  I have used the unit a total of about 15 minutes (!!!) before it died.  This was a NEW (NOT RECONDITIONED) unit.  And it's not that I want my money back per se, I just want to upgrade to a hopefully more reliable blower.  I guess SnowJoe isn't willing to look at this situation a little differently even though MY 622 IS ALMOST BRAND NEW, IT BROKE DOWN THE FIRST TIME I USED IT (15min), AND THE 622 IS AN ABSOLUTE PAIN TO REPAIR."

After that, I took it outside to deal with some snow and it really requires a lot of force and pushing to get over snow.  I have a thrust and push for it to get over piles, that's about the same amount of force I'd use with a shovel.  Also, one of the washerholders next to the left wheel came off and now the wheel moves to the center and makes the thing veer off to one side.  Also, the shooter got clogged with a wedge of ice/snow.  It takes several passes over a layer of snow to get rid of it.  Still, in low snowfall, this would certainly save some time.  And I guess in snow that isn't very wet at all, it might be easier to use.  Obviously, looking at the thing, I wouldn't recommend you use it on high accumulations or wet snow.

However, I wouldn't use it to try and move heavy amounts of slush or ice, or snow that has been compacted and on the ground for several days. My neighbor cleared this type of snow with a heavy duty gas snow blower that he payed $800 for, and I don't think the Snow Joe, with its many plastic parts, could handle this type of workload. So if you buy this machine with the right expectations and are willing to clear snow several times during a significant snow storm, then the Snow Joe is a great product for the price. Also, I was going to buy the Toro electric snow thrower but the price was jacked up to $400 dollars during this storm, so the Snow Joe really was a bargain for $249."

So I give Amazon a '5' for having it in stock and getting it to me overnight! BUT I give the whole ordeal and product a 3.5 because it was broken when I opened the box.  I never had a snow thrower before and it helped me get 3 feet of snow AND slush off my driveway and walkway.  But is no good on the ice of course.  THE HUGE problem, since the top that directs the snow was broken I had to keep stopping and turning it with my hand, and then it would sometimes pop completely off. Since it was broken I couldn't attach the turn handle.  Also, the wheel was off, so I had to partially disassemble it to get the wheel back on.  But after fighting with the turning 'spouty' thing, I still felt like 'she woman' finishing my drive and walkway before the neighbors, with no male assistance!

It LOOKS under-powered, but looks can be deceiving.  Electric motors actually have more torque than gas powered of a similar size.  I've used it in 12-14 inches of snow and it did alright, even though it doesn't have self-drive and you have to push it.  It is best not to let anything accumulate over 8-10 inches, then it cuts through it like butter.  It also is good and scraping right down to the concrete.  It does alright with 6 inches of packed / slushy stuff too, but it is far better to use it when the snow is fairly fresh.  While you can't really compare this to much larger gas powered snow blowers that were meant to throw much deeper snow, compared to a gas powered unit of similar size, or slightly larger... this thing is superior.  You don't have to worry about maintaining it or starting it after it's been sitting for nearly a year.  The handle detaches and you can put the unit on a shelf, so it doesn't take up much garage space.  About the only drawback is keeping the cord out of the way as you back up, but you get used to it.  Make sure you use a good 15+ Amp heavy duty extension cord or you may run into problems.  If you live in an area where the snow accumulation of 12+ inches in one night is a rare thing, and you have a small driveway and walkway to clear... this is perfect little unit, especially for the price and the maintenance-free aspects.  I shoveled our driveway with the first big snow of this last season and had a 2 day back ache.  I've used this unit a half-dozen times since, an as far as I'm concerned... it paid for itself the first time I used it!"

But we never get much snow here. It sat in my garage, completely unopened until today. We received (so far) about 8 or 9 inches of very dry snow, but the ground was warmer, and the snow wetter at the concrete surface of my driveway. I was really looking forward to playing with a new 'toy'! I'm a 47 year old guy, ok?! :)Assembly was a breeze ... didn't even need the directions. What guy does? Very easy and only a small amount of screws. Needed a phillips screwdriver of my own. Little wrench supplied is a p.o.s. but it worked. Use your own crescent wrench or pliers. Assembly took mere minutes and I was good to go.There is a push-button switch on the right side of where you plug in your grounded heavy gauge electrical cord. DO NOT use something small. This will pull some amps. But the small switch threw me ... I squeezed the handle ... nothing. Thought it was DOA ... didn't read the directions as I said earlier. Saw the switch, pushed it, pulled the handle VOILA! Action! This thing plowed through 4 or 5 inches of initial snowfall on a concrete driveway with ease. However, it does NOT throw 20 feet. At best, I got maybe like 4 or 5 feet? My driveway is about 20 feet across so this was the only real problem and aggravation I had. Doing it again, I would start in the MIDDLE and work outward, so that I am not throwing snow onto a cleaned surface.the chute did clog with heavier and wetter amounts of snow attempted, but I just jostled the thing up and down to free the clog. Worked for me. I was able to do my driveway and walkway, then took it to a woman who lives alone and cleaned her driveway and walkway. Then came back home and made another pass on my driveway again. It handled it all very well.. The only other 'issue' was not with the SnowJoe, but having to lug around an extension cord in below-freezing temps. That was a little tedious, but meh.I know other reviews have rated this poor, and my guess is there are some lemons out there. I was fortunate not to have gotten a lemon. Mine worked VERY well and is a back saver for sure!Can't give it 5 stars because it does not throw 20 feet, and dragging the electrical cord around was kind of a pain making sure it didn't get in the way. But a solid 4 stars for sure!***Edited 2/23/2010; reduced to 3 stars. My second day of use resulted in an internal bolt rattling loose and sent the whole unit flying apart inside! I had to quickly stop the blower by releasing the saftey handle, then unplugging it. The resulting bolt coming loose tore apart the plastic housing, and bent part of the metal/plastic/rubber augar mechanism. This had happened to previous reviewers; and it happened to me.I would therefor say, that if you DO buy this, you really MUST go through the tedious action of assuring that all the bolts on the augar are completely tightened; and perhaps do so after each use. That could be a deal-breaker for buying one. Fortunately, the snow I had here in Williamsburg, VA ended for the most part the same day the snow blower broke. It worked very well for me ... right up until it tore itself apart!"

We prefer outdoor equipment that runs on electricity and this was the first electric snow blower I'd seen. I ordered it on Amazon because with free shipping, it was $25 less than at Lowes! I should add that I have just a short 2-car driveway and a path to the rear of the home to clear, so I didn't want a heavy-duty high-priced machine.It arrived faster than predicted so I had it for our New Year's 3-day snowstorm. This probably wasn't the best test, as we were away for 24 hours, so when I got back and used the snowblower, there was wet, plowed up heavy snow, and this is a light duty machine. It was slower clearing what the plows built up, and at one point I pushed some snow over with a shovel to make it less deep. Still easier than picking it up with the shovel and carrying it to throw it! For the two storms since then I was able to start sooner and it worked great.It does strain in heavy snow. You can hear the engine pitch change. I change the angle slightly and work my way through it. Once in a while there is a slight burning or hot smell, but it goes away and hasn't affected operation. Of course, you have to keep track of the electric cord, which might drive some people crazy, but I ran an electric lawn mower for a long time and am used to it. Reviewers recommended the 12-gauge extension cord for more power so I got that.  Some said the Snow Joe doesn't throw the snow far enough - I find I wish it didn't throw as far as it does! I invariably plaster a wall or window with the stuff here and there and need to be aware of the direction it is throwing all the time. Of course, my driveway is small as I said.So I find it easy to run - except in plowed up heavy snow when I didn't get to it soon - and it performs well for what I need. It is saving my back over the long haul. Pushing and pulling it around is still exercise, mind you, just not as bad for the back.It was easy to assemble - in fact it seemed like it was slightly more assembled than the instructions indicated, as if they are assembling it more than they used to when they created the instructions. It is light and easily put in and taken out of the shed, but it has enough power moving and throwing the snow for my purpose. So far so good!"

I followed the directions inserted in the box 'DO NOT return this Snow Joe product to the retailer'  So, I called Snow Joe's customer service as directed by the instructions enclosed on the day that I received the product.  I am still without a working snow thrower over a month later!  They told me that I would receive a fully assembled lower chute crank (which was bended) to the discharge chute within a week.  Two weeks later,  I called and they told me the parts were on back order.  Then two days later, I received two separate packages one containing the collar only then a second package containing a collar and a lower chute crank.  No assembled unit as promised.

And so I called Snow Joe's customer service telling them of my dilemma, once again I was told that I would received a fully assembled discharge chute with the lower chute crank attached.

Very excited to try the electric as I really did not want to fidget with another gas engine, especially in the winter when you need the snow blower to get out of your driveway to get gas for the snowblower....It worked very well, even with the weird two-prong electrical (good luck finding a 100', exterior, 2-prong extension cord).  When I first brought it home to use, I noticed the wire snapped over the frame bar when I folded it down.  The cord wasn't long enough to fold it down.  So that irked me a bit, but I repaired it myself as I had over 2' of snow in the driveway and it worked great!  A lot of power for a little machine.It snowed another 3' a day or two later so I brought it out again.  I got to the end of the driveway before I got a chunk of snow and it broke out the entire backing that holds in the blade.  It was cheap, 1/8' plastic with another design deficiency.  The cover behind the piece that broke out acts as a second blade with nowhere to blow the snow, so snow gets jammed in there and most likely contributed to the piece busting out.  There was no using it after that, so I called the manufacturer as I haven't even had it a week.  The guy there was incredibly short, borderline rude and said that I had to mail the whole unit to NJ on my dime.  This costs around $80, more than 30% of the unit with no guarentee they would honor the warranty.  Thank God Amazon is so awesome, I received a no questions refund, even for my shipping it to them.I read another bad review that their unit has been in Snow Joe's possesion for 3 months after their's broke without receiving contact or update.  They still haven't received it back or been able to contact them.  I am now going with the equivelant Toro with my refund, especially after I read the one star review of the guy who had it 2.5 years before the motor burned out.

Got 6+ inches in our area so we got to use our Snow Joe snow blower twice today. It met our expectations. My next door neighbor was using his gas powered 2 stage snow thrower at the same time we were using the Snow Joe and he completed his task in no time at all. I can't, and didn't, expect an electric snow blower to do the same job as a gas powered 2 stage blower. Although it took longer to complete (as other posters have stated, you should not force the Snow Joe into large amounts of snow but must move it slowly) clearing the snow off our driveway and sidewalk, it did an excellent job completing the task. It will throw snow about 8-10 feet with the chute facing forward and about 3-4 feet with the chute angled. Some suggestions: it is a much easier job if two people are engaged in the task. I was pushing the snow blower while my wife was 'managing' the electric cord. If you are using it yourself, as I did during my second use of it, and go 'side to side' on your driveway with the Snow Joe instead of 'up and down' you will find there will be no entanglement of the electric cord.  Using this method I was able to shoot the snow forward without getting any snow on my neighbor's driveway. I am very satisfied with the performance of this product. My wife and I are 60 years old and using the Snow Joe sure beats using shovels. When we purchased the Snow Joe we paid $249 for it. It is now selling for $199 on Amazon.  That's a great price!Today is February 14th, 2010 and I thought I would update my review.  We had a huge snowstorm last week and got over 10 inches of snow.  Of course I didn't wait until all 10 inches were on the ground and used the Snow Joe twice.  Still an amazing machine!  Cleared the snow off and just left a very thin layer on the driveway.  Again, it doesn't work as well as my neighbor's 2 stage gas snow blower (time wise, he finished 15 minutes before me)but it did the job!  Love the Snow Joe!Here is another update:  Today is February 22nd, 2010 and we got six inches of our first 'heavy slushy snow' overnight.  Had to wait until I got home from work in the evening to shovel, so the snow was pretty packed.  Based on some of the negative reviews I have read here, I decided to use a shovel instead of the Snow Joe, fearing the heavy snow might break it.  After shoveling a little bit, my lower back started hurting.  I decided to at least try the Snow Joe to see how it would do.  We must have 'lucked out' getting this particular Snow Joe.  It cleared our driveway completely, all the way down to the pavement.  This is some machine!  My wife and I feel this is one of the best investments we have ever made.Update:  Today is January 21. 2012 and we've had our Snow Joe for two years now and have had no trouble with it.  Got 6 inches of snow yesterday and took the Snow Joe out again this morning.  Once again, it cleared the snow off our driveway and sidewalk.  Some key things I do to keep our Snow Joe operating optimally: BEFORE winter sets in, I use WD40 to grease the auger and chute housings to prevent wet snow from clogging them; I check all bolts and tighten any that have loosened; When there is heavy wet snow, I clear a short path with a shovel first and only use the Snow Joe to remove a 10-12' width of snow at a time so I don't burn out the motor; I use a shovel to clear what the snow plows leave at the end of my driveway.  Ice can be packed in this type of snow bank and can crack the plastic housing of the chute and auger of the Snow Joe if I try to remove this snow; I dry the Snow Joe off when I finish, rotate the chute to ensure it is working, and rotate the auger to make sure nothing is stuck to it.Update:  Today is March 6, 2013 and we received 9 inches of continuous snow yesterday.  Worked from home yesterday and went out at noon, 3 PM, and 7 PM to clear the snow and then at 7:00 AM this morning.  The snow was the heavy slushy kind so it was good that I shoveled the snow in intervals.  I had no problems with the Snow Joe. I believe it would have been hard for the Snow Joe to throw 9 inches of the heavy packed stuff at once if I had allowed the snow to accumulate.  Watched a neighbor with a Toro gas snow blower snow throwing the snow from his drive way this morning after it had all accumulated overnight and he had a difficult time.  He was shoving the blower into the pile of snow, pulling back, and repeating his actions.  I made a dumb mistake today and tried to untangle my cord while keeping the machine running.  The auger pulled in the cord, cut it up, and I lost power immediately.  Took me about 15 minutes to untangle the cord from the auger.  Fortunately it did no damage to the motor and I was able to continue using the Snow Joe using another cord.  Will not make that mistake again.  All in all, I am very happy with our Snow Joe."

We don't have a lot to shovel, but due to our average snowfall, it still gets tiresome.  Now, I look forward to shovelling.I looked at the Toro, but opted to spend a little more for the MTD Snow Fox.  I wish it had a little more powerful motor.  The handle should be adjustable for people taller than Danny DeVito.  I have to stoop to use it.  Also, the low angle of the handle makes getting into tight places a challenge.  That's my main disappointment, but it isn't anything that would discourage me from recommending it.The Fox comes with a three position chute for directing the thrown snow.  Here's where a more powerful motor would really improve the machine.  In either of the angled positions (straight ahead, 45 degrees to the right or left) the snow dribbles out of the machine.  This is inspite of the fact that in the straight position the snow shoots out 20 feet.I took the cover off of mine and used my Dremel to add an extra position for the chutes.  Now, my blower is a 5 position model.  All I need now is to swap in a 5 hp motor (c;"

I got this machine after our first snow in late December.  Since the east coast has been hogging all the snow this winter, I hadn't had a chance to use it here in South Dakota (usually the harsh winter capital of the nation) until mid-February.  Now that I have, though, I'm very pleased.As mentioned by others, throwing snow to the side only moves it about six feet.  This worked fine for my sidewalks (the 12-inch cut let me get the whole sidewalk in three furrows, which took about five minutes).A pointer for anyone clearing a small amount of snow:  I worked out a decent system for the driveway where i start down the middle and throw snow a few feet to each side as I work my way to the edges.  By the time I get to the edges, I'm throwing the accumulated pile off onto the grass.  This clears the driveway rather well, though obviously it wouldn't be as useful in 20 to 30 inches of snow as some other people have seen this winter.Power cord management is the only real downside to this device.  I find myself spending a pretty good amount of time tossing the cord out of my way as i go and down the driveway.  It's a minor annoyance that i still hope to find a solution for.In all, i can now clear my drive and sidewalk in 20 minutes or so rather than the 45 to 60 minutes it took me by shovel.  it also fits neatly in my crowded garage.

Living in the city I don't have the room or need for a 'big' snow thrower and the Snow Fox was the perfect compromise.  With the blades pointed straight forward the Snow Fox easily throws the snow over 20 feet and as others have written, when you set the blades to the left or right the range decreases to 4-6 feet.  The Fox has a short handle in addition to the 'push handle' which is really useful for very deep snow.  You can hold the machine from the short handle because its so light and cut thru drifts pretty effectively.  No assembly is required unless you consider tightening the handle to be 'assembly.'  I''m a bit of a tool junkie and the Snow Fox is a great value for someone that doesn't aspire to become a full time landscaper/snow plower.  One additional point, the company that makes the Snow Fox has a great story worth mentioning.  I've attached the 'History' from their website.  take a chance on this machine, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised... The American DreamMTD Products Inc. was founded in 1932 in Cleveland as a tool and die supplier to the local manufacturing community. The founders, Theo Moll, Emil Jochum, and Erwin Gerhard, were skilled tradesman who left their homeland and traveled to the United States with little but character and vision. Through their hard work, dedication, integrity and an emphasis on customer service, the company rapidly grew, and these qualities remain our core values.MTD quickly gained a reputation as a high quality tool and die supplier, and this reputation helped the company make the natural expansion into steel stampings. The company became involved with consumer products by supplying stampings to the toy industry, but this expanded quickly to include complete products such as tricycles. Wheelbarrows were added to the consumer product line in the early fifties, and this simple product line had profound effects. Satisfied customers encouraged MTD to expand the product offerings for the yard, and in 1958 the company produced its first lawnmower. Today, MTD is a global leader in outdoor power equipment with manufacturing in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.MTD Products has earned a reputation around the world for excellence in quality and service and is the innovator in each respective business unit. The company remains privately held and closely aligned to the core values of our founders, whose example set our standard."

I'd bought the Snow Fox ahead of time just in case, and it works great for me.The main problem for us is the driveway - 80ft long, 10ft wide and right down the side of the house. I can shovel the path in the front yard and the sidewalk, but it takes a good 90 minutes to get any serious snow off the driveway like that.The Snow Fox does a great job for me. The blower chute has three directions. Left and right it throws about 8ft. Ahead it throws about 15ft. It's electric, so there's the potential hassle of the cable following behind you, but that also means it's pretty quiet. You can use this without waking up your neighbours. The cut width is about 13 inches and there is a little spillage either side when you use it, but nothing to worry about.It took me about 20 minutes to clear our driveway of 4 inches of snow (remember about 800 sq. ft)Because it's electric, the snow paddles don't quite reach the ground. Instead there's a blade type affair right at the bottom. To use the Snow Fox, you need to tip it slightly forward so the blade scrapes along the ground.  When you get it, you might think the handle is way low, but once you lift it to a comfortable height, the amount of forward tip is perfect and it drives the little blade under the snow. This scoops the snow as you push forward and the paddles throw it out through the snow vanes.This is probably not the snow-blower for large jobs, but it's quiet, and it works great for small driveways and paths.I concur with the other reviewers about the shipping and handling. My Fox arrived in perfect condition but the box was totally hosed by the time it got to us."

It makes holiday postcards look pretty, but boy, I sure don't like shoveling it.  When I threw out my back in '94, I was prohibited from doing any type of labor that would put a strain on my back.  As enjoyable as it was watching my wife shovel the sidewalk and driveway at 5:00 AM, our marriage counselor suggested we find another solution to our snow-clearing problems.We briefly hired a neighborhood kid to help us out, but one morning I caught him giving my wife &quot;the eye&quot;, so I fired him.  That left us with no choice, but to look into purchasing a snow blower.I tried out a number of different gas-powered snow blowers, but none of them blew as well at the electric Snow Fox.  Sure, your range of blowing is limited by the length of your extension cord, but if you have a short sidewalk like chatchi, then you won't mind the limited reach.The 8.5 amp amatek electric motor makes easy work of any blanket of snow Mother Nature might throw your way.  However, don't be surprised if you have to blow the same areas more than once.  Sometimes the Snow Fox doesn't blow everything the first time, so repeated passes are often necessary to clear the path you need.It's not as powerful as a gas-powered blower, but when you want an efficient, fairly priced snow blower, the Snow Fox is all you'll need to get your blowing done right."

It also has rear wheels which will help me manuver it easier rather than manually shoveling.  The reason I wanted an item like this in the first place was to avoid all of that pushing.

I have used it on snow that is taller that the whole machine and it took it with aplomb, which not to say it was fast when taking on 14 inch snow drifts: I was shaving off only about 1/3 width slices, but how often do you get 14 inches of snow in one night? It can be easily operated with one hand when taking on snow of 5 or 6 inches or less. It's quite convenient to pick up and use it like a shovel, except, of course, you don't have to throw the snow. I have a standard 2 car suburban drive way and it took me 1 3/4 hours to clear a 12-14 inch snow fall, which sounds like a lot of time, but when the snow is 5-6 inches, it only takes the amount of time to clear that it would take you to walk the rows. I don't find the cord to be a problem: I coil it at the top of the drive and row by row work my way down.

"212","XX","B0002IKVN6","5.0","April 19, 2010","AKMK87KXYCFWS","So far, so good....","This machine does an excellent job of filling the gap between the two-stage gas-powered behemoths and the small underpowered shovel-handle type electric snow throwers.  I wanted something that would eat through enough snow and throw it far enough to clean my driveway and sidewalk, without the hassle of maintenance /storage of the gas powered machines.  Where we live in the Northeast we only get 3+ inch snow fall a few times per year, and this machine is perfect for that.  I've used the Snow Fox twice so far and it has performed superbly in about a foot of recent snow.  True to spec, when it was set to throw straight, the range was a good 20ft.  When set to right/left the distance shrunk to no more than 3ft, but this is perfectly acceptable for sidewalk cleaning when you want to just create a narrow path for pedestrians.  I would recommend the straight setting for driveways.The Snow Fox comes assembled and all that is required is to screw the handle to the base (with included easy-to-turn screws).  This is simple enough and can be done in less than 3 minutes.  Removing the handle is a good idea for storage and once removed, the Snow Fox takes up about as much room as one of those dorm-room refrigerators.I do have a few minor gripes:-The extension cord management device leaves room for improvement as it does not easily accommodate the larger gauge extension cord plugs.-While the Snow Fox can take on more than 6' at a time, any piles greater than 12' will need multiple 'shavings' to get the job done.  The reason I don't take a star off for this is that the only kind of machine that can manage such piles would be the aforementioned gas powered behemoths.  In any case, multiple passes with this machine is a lot easier on the back than doing so with a hand shovel.  This is a you-get-what-you-pay-for kind of deal.-The business end (blade) of the machine is made of plastic, and while it does a great job with freshly fallen snow, I would not try it on hardened or iced-over snow that typically forms the day after a snowfall.  If possible, use this machine the day of the snowfall to preserve the blade.I recommend the Snow Fox as a great niche-filler for those like me who do not want to mess with the gas variety (and don't want to spend thousands) but want more power and utility than a small snow thrower.  As long as the plastic blade doesn't wear out during subsequent snowfalls I don't see why the Snow Fox wouldn't last me for years to come.  If this doesn't turn out to be the case, I'll be back here, updating the review."

Yes, it does have its limitations as other reviewers have noted.  You need to use it when snow is no more than 4-5 inches.  The left and right throwing angles don't project the snow very far (but the straight shot sends the snow well clear of where you need it to be removed from).  Get a good extension cord.

One bad winter woudn't justify a $400+ heavy-duty snowblower.  Got this to assist with cleanup and use in future winters.  It arrived in a much smaller box than I expected.  The handle and the blower are separate items; putting them together is a snap.  You just screw them together.  Instructions are clear and operation is very simple.  It's very light and small, making it easy to move around.It works exactly as you'd expect.  Just point and shoot.  Snow is flung much further when the vanes are pointed straight ahead than when they are pointed to the sides.  It goes through dense, packed snow easily.  Operated for 10-20 minutes at a time without overheating or losing efficiency.  It was so light that I could literally put it on top of 2'-4' of snow, move it back and forth and essentially 'grind' the snow down.  Within a few passes,the 2'-4' snow was gone and clear pavement was visible.  Smaller stuff a few inches high was dispatched very quickly.  The small size allows it to get into tight spots.That said, it is NOT a heavy-duty snowblower.  It is not going to clear out vast amounts of snow quickly and easily.  But it doesn't claim to be any such thing.  If you're looking for a heavy-duty snowblower this isn't it.  If you're looking for something to clear out a few inches or to use at intervals during a storm to pevent huge buildups, it'll get the job done.  Just make sure you get a long, thick power cord.Overall, I give it 5 stars for doing exactly what it said it would at a moderate (by snowblower standards) price."

It was a real help, but clearly overwhelmed by our 30+ inches of snow, even though I never let more than 6'-10' accumulate.  I'd say it should work well as advertised with up to 6' of snow per storm, and it can handle more by taking two or three passes.  The biggest issue is that it can only throw left or right over a 15' or so border and only for a few feet, so once you have cut a path and the snow has built up on the sides, it won't throw the snow over the side.  It really does throw 20' or so straight ahead (at a much higher angle), so I found myself cutting in a herringbone pattern.  I think this will work fine for our normal light snows and I'm happy with how little space it takes to store it, but I wish I had spent $100 more and gotten the SnowJoe 622 that can throw over a higher bank.  If you get regular snows of 12+ inches, you'll need a bigger machine. If you want to help out your neighbors, get a gas powered one so you're not constrained by a cord.

It actually threw that wet snow 10-12'. I would expect much more distance is light powdery snow of 3-4 '. I lubricated the blade and snow deflectors with a product called Snow Jet that is designed to keep the snow from sticking to the plastic parts. I use it on my gas blower and it works well. I've used my neighbors Toro 1800 and it works well in powder but is useless in wet snow. I attribute that to the fact that the Toro has a chute that the snow must be channeled into and thrown out where the MTD simply throws it forward. The MTD deflectors did not work well in wet snow but then I never thought they would. Overall I'm pleased with the product and found it to work well.

We typically get one or two major snowfalls a year, and the Snow Fox has done the job in short order every time, hanging out-of-the-way on the wall of the garage otherwise.  No messing around with gas or oil, just plug it in and away it goes.  Nothing has broken for ME.  I've used it on 10'+ snowfall and it works great.We have a long driveway and steps up to a walkway to steps up to the landing for the front door.  Not only does the Snow Fox blow the snow several feet forward (I'm not sure 25, but plenty), but it's easily lifted up to the walkway where, resetting the vanes with a simple twist, the Snow Fox, er, tosses the snow a bit off to one side - which is perfect, really, for the application.I've only had two problems, which relate to the extension cord.  First off the blower's plug is set within a sort of cup supposed to prevent you from plugging in the kind of cord that has a little tang on the extension cord's female plug, if you know what I mean.Second, I occasionally run over the cord...  But the great thing about the Snow Fox (I don't know how this compares to other blowers) is that whenever I run over the cord or other impedimenta in the snow (frozen wad of leaves, stick, stray piece of twine) it immediately stops, and it's easy to counter-rotate the blades and dislodge the item.  And it goes right back to work, no problem!Where *I* live, the kids don't come around with shovels after a snowfall - the guys with the plow do, and they want $100 to push a pile of snow up against the garage door and pound the rest into a slippery smear on the asphalt.

I've used it in three separate snowfalls this year and I am a satisfied customer. Most of the reviews I have seen here have been positive and I generally agree with what they say. Some have been negative and I will address some of their points:1. The choice for most people is between a $600 gas-powered snow thrower that they will use two or three times a year and a $160 electric snow thrower (I actually bought mine from the factory for $140) that they also will use two or three times a year. So if you fault the machine for not being as brawny as a gas-powered thrower you must credit it for being a relatively inexpensive alternative to a tool of only occasional value.2. The need to replace scrapers and augers, based on my experience, comes from improper use of the machine. If you hold it too vertical, the scraper and auger will come in contact with the pavement. You can tell when you're doing that by the grinding noise it makes. That's why those pieces will wear. If you insist on scraping down to entirely bare pavement, that's what will happen with any snow thrower.3. You do need to keep cord management in mind when you are operating the machine. Any run of cord longer than 200 feet is going to reduce power and using small-gauge cord will do the same. You need at least 14-gauge power cord. If you attach the cord according to directions, using the cord tether supplied with the machine, the cord will not drop off. You have to be careful not to run over the cord, because it will jam the auger. Just remember, when you have to stop to relocate the cord, that this little electric machine always will start the first time, every time.4. It's indisputable that the Snow Fox throws snow to the side a far shorter distance than it throws directly ahead. The way to address this issue - if it's a problem for you - is to clear a driveway with diagonal cuts, so that snow you blow directly ahead of you is well away from the driveway. Trying to do it lengthwise on a driveway will mean you have to move the same snow more than once.5. There's no question that using the Snow Fox is more time-consuming than using a 20-inch, gas-powered machine. However, because it's so light using it is not nearly as tiring as shoveling or pushing a heavy, gas-powered machine. Again, in most places (I'm in Indianapolis) you're only going to use it a few times a year. And please refer again to my points #1 and 3. In addition, it makes a lot less noise than the two-cycle engines of the gas-powered blowers.This year, we had a 12-inch snowfall, which is rare. I wondered whether the Snow Fox would be up to the job. I found out, to my surprise, that by reducing the swath a little and by using the diagonal technique described above, it did a fine job. Took longer than it would have with my neighbor's big Toro, but it handled the task.The next week, we had a four-inch snowfall that was right down Snow Fox Alley. I would bet that my little electric thrower did just as well as the big boy next door. And that was with an immediate start, a quiet motor and no two-cycle exhaust.Hope those comments answer some criticism. If you have a snow-clearing rage of less than 200 feet, live in an area with less than two feet of snowfall a year and have no concerns about your masculine image, I say give the Snow Fox a try."

I do two swaths down the left side of the deck and the snow goes clear across the street to the other side.  Then I work from the cleared strip from left to right on the deck so the snow gets piled on the right side, which the plow drivers like.When we get a berm from the plow, my husband chops up the berm and I 'throw' it across the street.  It arches over the plowed street.  Today I moved 9 inches of lighter snow with 2 inches of slush/ice under it.  The key is to go out when there is less accumulation.  Its not so noisy that you couldn't use it at 10 pm and worry about bothering the neighbors.  Also, don't wait till the temps get above freezing.  All snow starts to melt into itself at that point and becomes very heavy, even for the monster machines.  I'm sooooooo glad I bought this."

However, we weren't willing to shell out $400 for some of the large, gas powered snow machines. This machine does a perfectly nice job.Pros:-  No gasoline needed-  Easy to operate and quick startup-  Lightweight enough for my 10 year old daughter to run-  It will handle snow much deeper than the 'recommended' height if you go slowCons:-  You need to manage the electric cord-  Snow is not thrown very far (this can be good or bad actually)-  Narrow swath compared to gas models-  Mostly plastic parts (however this is a good thing if you run over the electric cord...trust me)Unless you absolutely need a wider and heftier snow thrower, this performed very well during a snowy Chicago winter.

Unfortunately we were having some pretty heavy snowstorms and my neighbors laughed at me because it was like trying to cook a Thanksgiving dinner in a Susie Homemaker Oven... not too effective!

Our gas blower crapped out on us last winter.  In Wisconsin, we had our second highest total December snowfall on record.  January is now over and so far we have had a ludicrous amount of snow.  So my Snow Fox has been used extensively already.  I would say a 4.5 star rating is more accurate.  But you can't select a half star.  We have an average size Madison city driveway and sidewalk.  For snow 2' to 6', using the Snow Fox makes far more sense then using a gas blower.  For 6' to 12' it still does a fine job.  It's light enough to easily push with one hand.  The other hand guides the extension cord.  It clears the snow just as fast as a single stage gas blower.  Mine hangs on a hook on the garage wall when I'm done.You will have to experiment with the directions you take clearing your driveway.  Getting use to the cord was annoying at first.  But once I fashioned a loop out of a rope and hung it from the garage door so the cord was raised, there was no longer a hassle with the cord.One huge benefit; I have an office job.  It has been nice not going into work smelling like gas or exhaust fumes after clearing my driveway in the morning.Bottom line....if you have an average house in the burbs, this is far more practical then a gas blower."

The sidewalks were a breeze and kind of fun to do.

I just wanted something to save my back from having to move the same snow three times or more, in order to get it all the way from the part of the deck nearest the house's exterior wall onto the ground.As I expected, having used a big snowthrower in the past, this little fellow will handle a drift only in increments.  That's fine.  I can either go out and clear it once for every four-inch installment of snowfall, or I can take off the whole drift by doing it in layers.  If it clogs, I just hold it up (in one hand, it's so light!) and tap it against the deck.  Out comes the clog, and I'm back in business.The ability to change the throw direction, using a chute just like on a big machine, makes this far superior to a so-called power shovel.  I need the wheels.  I cannot hold a power shovel up the requisite couple of inches; even though the unit may be light enough to carry, holding anything suspended that way absolutely kills my back.The SnowFox is just what I needed.

While it is clear that during heavier snows I will have to go out every 6', that's ok with me.  I usually do that with the shovel anyway because shoveling 30' at one time is so hard for me.It took me couple of times using it to get the knack of dealing with the cord, but I have my system now, and it goes quick.  Also, I learned to cover my face because unless it's really still, I'm pretty covered with snow by the time I'm done.  I prefer to use it blowing straight out because it seems to have more power that way.  This also requires some finess so that you aren't always blowing the snow where you've just cleared.  It feels to me like it's faster than shoveling, but I honestly don't time it.  I can tell you though, that I'm NOT exhausted when I'm done, and my back doesn't hurt. This is so light!!  I would compare it to vacuming the house.I was also able to clear some higher drifts (over 2') by picking it up using it to scoop out snow.Don't mistake this for a heavy duty snow blower, you'll be disappointed.

However, will barely move snow out of the way when discharging to left or right.-Light and maneuverable, handles make it easy to pick-up to clear steps and such-Like all throwers where the scraper is designed to always contact the ground, this model does not like uneven surfaces such as tilted concrete slabs or gravel.  It will catch on the edges and stop moving forward or the impeller will strike the ground.-Managed to crack the impeller by striking a stone or something and jamming it against the housing.  Crack did not reduce performance and made machine look more menacing.-Unit shipped fully assembled.  Plusses and minuses here ...  sure you don't have to put it together, but the carton is huge and light and poorly braced inside.  My carton arrived crushed.  Handles on thrower were bent, but straightened easily when I took 'em across my knee.-Hangs on the pegboard nicely out of the way.-Due to resistance losses you are limited to 150 feet of power cord length.Finally, remember the old adage ...

I had been buying the rectangle kid pools which would last two weeks or so.  They were only $30. so buying 3 a summer seemed like an okay deal.  After thinking about it for a year I purchased this Intex pool and I wish I had done it last year.  Great price!  Great product!It was incredibly easy to set up although you definitely need 1 or 2 people to help you spread the pool out just prior to and during the addition of water to keep folds out of the bottom.  Other than that, it was a breeze!My son and his friends have sooo much fun in this pool and I have enjoyed it too.  I grew up with an in-ground pool but am not ready to make that investment because we may be moving.  It appears to be very sturdy and manageable.  I use the pump during the day for about 8 hours to keep it clean and purchased a water skimmer and chlorine tablets.  The tablet floats around in the turtle container I purchased and the pool has stayed crystal clear so the maintenance is minimal.  I also purchased the solar cover that I put on at night and the ground cover.  All of these items I bought, including replacement filters, from Amazon for $150.Best. Purchase. Ever.Also, I was a bit concerned due to the high volume of people who stated that having a &#34;flat&#34; surface was an issue.  We have a large cement area in front of our garage, off the deck and I placed it there, on the ground cover and it's perfect.  I'm guessing that if I had placed it on the grass it may have not worked as well, especially since we have some pockets in the yard.  I wasn't really interested in putting it on the grass anyway."

When it got damaged in a storm, I replaced with the same pool. That's how much I enjoy this pool/size. I can't give this pool enough stars. It's great quality for the money. If it wasn't for a tree falling on it, it would have lasted at least 3 years and likely more if stored properly.As the name suggests, it is easy to set-up. I've done it by myself for 2 years but think it will go better with two, to make sure level and bottom stays smooth. The 18' size is great for 3 or 4 adults to float in on rafts. It is also good for kids to swim laps (for adults it's only a few strokes before you reach the other side but not bad).I've come to trust Intex since I use their pool, filter and floats. Main thing is making sure the pool is on level ground, no slight slope. I found my yard wasn't as flat as I thought so I have a deep end and a shallow end. I didn't realize how bad the slope was until the pool was filled and by that time I was committed. I just float in it, no aggressive activity so it's fine. It takes a day to fill and a day to empty, literally 24 hours each. Storage is probably the hardest part. I got it in a tote but couldn't get the lid on. It was enough to keep it protected in the garage. I figure this year I will fold up a different way and maybe it will fit better.I recommend getting the vacuum/skimmer accessories which keep the pool cleaner. Read description of item because it may come with it (my first did but replacement didn't). I also got the Intex salt filter which means no chemical maintenance, no chlorine smell. The 18' takes 3 bags of salt, possibly 4. And there is no salt taste like in the ocean, no green hair, no bathing suit damage. I wouldn't dream of not having a salt water pool.Shop around places for the best price. I didn't order from Amazon because it was cheaper elsewhere."

The first was given to me by a friend, and I was the third or fourth owner. The air ring had a slow leak. No big deal I figured, the thing was old anyway. Early this summer I got a new, off brand one for cheap at the local grocery store. It also had a leak in the air ring. I figured, well, that's what I get for buying an off brand piece of junk. Drained the pool and returned and got my money back. I then decided to get a good Intex one, $25 more than the off brand junk. Set it up, and two days later, another air leak!It's very frustrating to have to pump the air ring up a bit every single day. I had to arrange a neighbor to come over to inflate it every day while I was on vacation.What's even more frustrating is that I emailed the seller, Blue Fade Inc., about it and received not a single response. Nothing, just complete silence.Very unhappy.I will say however that otherwise build quality seems decent enough, pump seems good and nicer quality in every way than the off brand junk I bought prior to this one. My rating would be far higher if 1) there were no air leaks, and 2) Blue Fade had actually replied and provided some customer service."

I called Intex and was told by a representative they were not responsible because it was probably a packaging problem.  That is a great way to stand behind a product.I was given two options:  Patch it or send back the liner to be inspected.  If it was truly discovered (doubtful) to be Intex's fault, then I would be given a new liner.  If not, then the original would be returned.I patched it.The next problem was keeping it clean.  I followed the instructions that came with the pool.  I followed the instructions of the pool chemical companies.  I continued to have algae, even though I vacuumed.I brought water samples to a pool supply store.  I followed their directions.  I continued to have algae problems.For the winter, we drained and cleaned the pool.  We put new water in this summer.  Sediment continued to form on the bottom of the pool.

Numerous times they say that the tarp under the pool is an option!  Well if it is 'optional' then the pool must be sturdy.  I just happen to have a big blue tarp in the shed so I decided to use it.My 4 year used the pool 3 times before I realized that grass was growing through the tarp and the bottom of the pool, making it leak.  I re-consult my handbook and in very faded print it says that 'the manufacturer is not responsible for grass growing through the bottom and it is not a defect.'

We called the manufacturer only to find out that the pump is not warrantied against rain.(?!) They do not sell replacement plugs. The only way for us to fix the pump problem is to purchase a new pump at $39.99 + tax and shipping!If the ground is not perfectly level, you end up with folds in the liner that catch water under the ring, outside of the pool water leading to mosquito breeding grounds. After any precipitation, we have to go out and straighten the folds to remove excess standing water. Kids leaning on the side of the pool, or stepping in and out by lowering the floating ring causes a waterfall of pool water.For $75, we've probably gotten our money's worth out of it for the summer, but it certainly is designed as a 'throw away' unit rather than a quality investment.

So last year was the first year I used the pool. I bought it at Big Lots for like $79. Initial setup was easy if you have half a brain. Like others have said though, a level surface is critical or you won't get the full depth of the pool. I am 29 so still like to party a little and this pool has been a BLAST for weekends and parties. It is perfect because you can easily fit like 10-15 people in it sitting around the outside of the pool and the water comes right up to your shoulders. Absolute HEAVEN for just sitting around in drinking a few beers. Add on the Intex floating cooler and no one even has to leave the pool for another beer, lol.The first year I didn't have a single issue with the top ring. This year I am LUCKY if it stays inflated for more than 24 hours. When I first set it up this year, it went flat in an hour. I found 2 holes in the ring and patched them which makes it last about 24 hours on a good day. I have tried absolutely everything to find where it is leaking... soapy water, ceran wrap over the ring (to see if it blows up) and even a stethoscope! I can't find any leaks. Very frustrating and I've heard many people say the same thing. All in all though, for 80 bucks, I definately got my money's worth in fun and for cooling down in the insane Texas heat. Now I mow my yard in my bathing suit and every 15 mins or so... I jump in the pool for about 5 minutes to cool down, lol.The other thing I like about this pool is that mine seems to stay cool very well. It stays cooler than friends of mine who have real in-ground pools. I didn't expect that as I figured that it's design would make it get hotter. I think it is the opposite. The open air all around it helps it cool off at night where a real pool doesn't."

For us, no need for the expense and maintenance of an inground pool or needing to winterize a permanent above ground, we just wanted something for the kids to play with and won't cost us money after they are grown.  This fits the bill.  Now, I think it is imperative to say, as you realize these are inexpensive alternatives, the old notion of you get what you pay for comes into play.  This is not going to be a buy once and use for 10 years unless you're lucky.  More than likely this will last about three seasons, possibly only two.  The material can get holes in it very easily and you can only do so much patching.  Now in the first season I usually don't get any, but over time they do develop, especially after drying out and folding away.  So if you are willing to look at it as $100 or so a season and can live with that fine.  To me I think I'll end up buying 4 of these total, so my investment will be less than two grand for 10 to 15 summers of fun (including salt water system pump and filters) and that is fine with me, but go into it knowing your probably looking at 5 years total if lucky.Do listen to the other reviews, it says level ground for a reason, a slight slope won't work, get as close to level ground as possible or it will fill all to one side and you will have wasted a lot of water as all the water will run out.  Tip while filling, every half hour or so if using a garden hose like me, go around and lift the wall, this will keep from water building up over any fold and also keep it filling evenly.  Also, don't over-inflate the air ring, it doesn't need to be tight or over-inflated, it doesn't make a difference, and remember heat causes air to expand, a hot day with an over-inflated ring could cause it to pop. 2/3rds to 3/4 of the way inflater does the trick just fine.Now, I do recommend the salt water system for this, it keeps the water clean all summer for me with an initial $19 salt purchase.  Plus the bigger pump makes a world of difference and is programmable, definately worth it if you are planning on using these pools for years.  Also the solar cover makes a world of difference.  I think these are great especially since they come with everything you need but chemicals.  Our kids love having it and we use it a few hours a day it seems.  So it works well for us, but know what you are getting before purchasing."

We had some cloudy days initially, and ironically not as warm weather as we are used to seeing at this time of year. With the pool in the shade for most of the morning until noon, it doesn't get sun until after that. The temperature of the pool, went from 66 to around 70F on its own without the 4512 heater, and without real hot days. Now that I have the heater on today, its gone up about 4 degrees. I also just added this afternoon the 15' solar pool bubble wrap cover. That should hold the heat effectively, and in combination of the sun getting through the clear plastic, and this little gem of a radiator, I'm guessing the pool will get to 80F in one or two more days of this 85 to 87 weather. Not too shabby.The reason to buy the 15' round solar cover, is that it floats and fits perfectly INSIDE of the inflated ring. You put this on in afternoon or whenever kids aren't swimming and it helps to keep it warmer, and then at night, you can simply use the pool cover that fits over the 18 foot inflatable ring, right over the solar cover. Both in tandem should work just fine.The hoses that came with the pool pump for the Intex 18 foot pool work good with the 4512 heater, and if you bought the Intex salt water chlorine generator, there is one extra hose with that, and the right adapters (these do come with the pool and the heater), and along with one extra medium size hose this Solar heater provides, its a perfect and very easy to assemble combination. With this heater at at around $115 price, the Intex pool, and salt water generator, and lastly a $50 solar cover, I'm all in at less than $500. No chemicals, no expensive gas fired heater, about (4) $5.00 bags of Morton 40 lb bags of pool salt 9can be found at Walmart), 5000 gallons of water, and wa la you have a pretty decent set up that works for kids up to early teens, and very nice for adults who get 'hot' mowing the grass, and taking care of the kids all day, and their 'needs' so you can take a well earned cool dip in the evening when the kids are all worn out and calmly playing their xboxes or Wii's.My only suggestion, and its a minor one for the solar heater mfg., is to simply supply two 10 foot hoses, instead of the ~2 foot and ~4 foot ones that require the panel to be so close to the pool pump set up.Other than that, folks, how can you go wrong ?The pool can be taken down during the winter, and re-set up each year in about an hour, and versus an inground that may well be nicer, this is at least a factor of 80 to 100 times less expensive. And its not permanent either, so if you get tired of dealing with pools each year, then you just roll out some new sod in the 18 foot circle you burnt out in your yard !The solar salt water generator is a very cool device. It works with copper ion genrator, which converts the salt water to a very low level of chlorine. Barely detectable chlorine smell, crystal clear water, and the copper ions kill all the bacteria, along with the small amount of chlorine.  Its very soft water, and like swimming in 'Visine.'  Follow the directions, and definitely use the granular pool salt, pour it in around the edge of the pool a bag at a time, then stir it up using the pool brush and handle that comes with the pool. It will dissolve quickly, but I suggest running it with the pool pump for the full 24 hours so its thoroughly mixed. The chlorine generator will work better that way, and note that I tried to do it sooner,and it wasn't until all the salt was in there, and it had been mixed for a day that all the chemical strips tested out properly, and the pool had a good 'balance.'  It will take the recommended full 135 lbs of salt to get PPM up to the right level of salt. The directions are all pretty decent, but some of these high level tips may help you avoid some anxiety or trying to short cut anything, as we men often like to do. (women are better at following directions so for the moms who read this, just ignore what Im saying to the 'men.')P.S. The kids ranging from 8yrs to 15yrs absolutely love the pool. They'll probably get 'bored' of it in a few weeks and then its back to school. $500 for this gig is less than a family of 5 would spend for one JUST ONE weekend of so called 'fun' at a place like six flags, or some other commercially oriented place that is there to take your hard earned money.  If I only get 2 or 3 seasons out of this, it will have been more than worth the modest investment.  In just a couple of days of use, I already feel pretty good about the purchase even if something tears or breaks. Parts are easy to find too, and again, think about the fact a new inground pool maybe twice this size will run you at least between $40k and $50K without landscaping, take tons of chemicals that run you about $400 per year, and gas bills for heating it close to an extra $200 per month when you do need the heater.P.P.S. It takes about 15 to 16 hours to fill this pool with water from the garden hose. I didn't see that mentioned in any review of the pool, and so I thought I'd give the tip in case you are looking to buy this combination. Unless your yard is fairly level, and not on any slope, expect to buy play sand to level it. Also, If you are thinking of the 15' round pool, I'd humbly suggest you spend the extra few tiny $, and go with the 18' since it has the larger 1-1/2' hoses, more powerful pump, pool maintenance kit, and is about 15' round on the inside of the inflated ring at the top. (hence the purchase of ONLY a 15 ' solar bubble wrap cover. which fits neatly inside of the ring, and ring sort of protects it from easily blowing off the pool. if it gets windy, then just add the Intex cover which wraps over and around the inflated ring, and has a slick tie rope to hold it in place.) And even if you aren't willing to wait until mid-season when these typically go on sale, its still worth the $300 to $400 price you likely would pay for just this pool, plus any extra's for the heater, and salt water generator, and solar cover combo. Good luck and enjoy the fun !"

It would be easier to set up if your land is level.  We had to move the pool twice to try to get it more level.  I would suggest if your land is not very level, get some sand or more dirt to level out the area where you plan to place the pool.  We plan to do that next year, when we set it up again.  It is a easy pool to set up.  You just inflate the top ring, connect the pump, then turn on the water.  The pool walls rise as the water gets deeper."

Even an inch off from one side to the other will affect the way the pool fills. My ground was maybe a half-inch off from one side to the other. To compensate, I placed stacks of folded cardboard underneath the low side. I then placed a tarp that I purchased in addition to the tarp that was provided to cover the cardboard. I made the stack higher that it needed to be so that when the weight of the water pressed down on the pool, it ended up being mostly level. Once I got everything level and filled with abt an inch of water to verify, I was ready to connect everything.I purchased the Krystal Clear Saltwater system by Intex to use in conjunction with the filter that came with the pool. This was the most enjoyable part of the process. Everything fits together perfectly, no hose clamps or modifications needed. The whole process of connecting the filter pump and saltwater system to the pool took about 20 minutes.Tips:Cardboard really does work well as a 'leveler'.The whole 'takes 30 minutes to set-up' myth on the instructions is just that...a myth. Carve out at least an hour or two to set it up.If you are using the saltwater system with this pool, add the salt while the pool fills b/c it helps the salt dissolve faster which in turn means you can use the saltwater system fasterIf you can, just pay for the water truck to bring water then you can use it the same day. I filled my pool over a couple of days using city water...I shudder to think about what that bill is going to look like.After all of that, I think it's still a worthwhile purchase that I plan to enjoy all summer long."

I love the soft blow up sides. You don't have to worry about running in to it when swimming. Lounging across it with your legs or arms is wonderful. However, if you really want clean water you're going to have to upgrade to a bigger pump. The pump that comes with this pool (1,500 GPH) is not strong enough to keep it really clean. I would suggest trying it out for one season like I did. My child is grown so I don't have kids swimming in my pool, it's mostly adults relaxing and just enjoying the water. I don't like seeing stuff floating in my water so I've upgraded to the strongest pump the 4,000 GPH, but it's not without it's problems; the pump has airlock issues. You have to learn to work through this, I'm just learning, so I might have a different opinion after the remaining summer of dealing with it as I just got it working, a brand new pump!

The pool pump is substandard and the filter and pump will not keep the pool clean nor will you be able to vacuum the bottom with it. The units are too small and under powered. Buying bigger pumps and filters is an option but don't but theirs as they are poor quality ad will not keep the pool clean. The ladder is very weak and not made for adults even though they show adults in the pool I guess they are dropped in by helicopter. After the first season, I carefully cleaned and dried the pool and stored it in its original box in a cool dry place. This season we discovered everywhere the liner was folded it is leaking (over 10 leaks so far and It's been filling and leaking for 2 days.

It is great for lounging adults and kids until 12.Alot of the negative feedback I have been reading is what I would call 'human error' such as not making sure your ground was level, etc. Some are stating the hose holes were stretched so far that it wouldn't seal, that's because it was extremely un-level on one side causing more bulge (due to heavier water on that side and leveled out). That is common sense in my opinion.My husband put this pool up with the help of our 16 year old daughter while I was at work and it took them approximately 2 hours from start to finish.If I had to guess the downfall to this pool it would be my recommendation that it needs to have a little bigger pump and to purchase a skimmer that would catch the little bugs...the skimmer that comes with it is great for bigger insects, trash, etc.I am very pleased with this pool and highly recommend.HAPPY SWIMMING......... :)"

We purchased a stronger pump so the vacuum works well now. We also installed a salt water chlorinator and love how easy the pool is to maintain. We live in the bay area of California, and leave the pool up all winter, too, though not for swimming in the cold months. We were a little nervous about trying this, but wanted to save time, effort, and water, so decided to see what would happen. The only problem was that on cold nights, the inflated tube deflated enough to let water leak out over the side. So we just added some more air. Some air must then be let out again if the temperature is expected to get high enough to cause too much expansion. On the occasional nights when the temperature dipped down to close to freezing, we let the pump go all night long. Grandkids LOVE to come here because of the pool, and I exercise swim using a tether tied to a tree for a kind of treadmill swimming. Something that I was worried about was what effect gophers (we CAN'T get rid of them :(  )would have. Well, they do indeed tunnel under the pool, and you can see where, by the indentations on the pool bottom. But so far, the lining remains intact. If I had it to do over, I would have put some chicken wire on the ground under the ground cover.

So listen up folks... if you buy a replacement pump, or even buy a pool set for the first time, BEFORE you even use the pump for the first time, take it apart until you can remove the impeller. This is pretty simple requiring only about 4 or 5 screws be removed... just make sure you pay attention to how it comes apart (especially the washers around the impeller). Then go down to walmart, home depot, lowes, or any auto parts store and buy some EPOXY. This should be two different liquids (or gels) that come in two different tubes that you must mix together. This stuff is SUPER STRONG, and most are rated for 2,500 to 3,500 lbs per square inch of strength... like steel almost. So what your going to do is get a small paint brush, and 'paint' the impeller with epoxy, making a SUPER STRONG coat over the cheap plastic. Just make sure you don't get any on the inside of the hole in the center of the impeller where it slides onto the metal rod. Allow it 24 hours to dry (depending on what type of epoxy you use), and then reassemble the pump. I guarantee this will save you money and headaches in the long run. Also if any other plastic parts break on the pump, you can use this epoxy to fix/repair/strengthen them as well."

The skimmer that came with the pool did the larger insects just fine.My husband was not a firm believer in purchasing this pool, but now that he has had the whole summer to enjoy it, he finally said this week that he is glad we got this pool and how much he has enjoyed it...looking forward to next year...Hope this will help someone else who is interested in purchasing a pool...this certainly is an easy way to figure out if a pool is something that you would want and you are not out thousands of dollars to figure that out..."

We were just beginning to really enjoy the summertime swimming, and I didn't have the money right now to buy a new above ground swimming pool, so I was looking for an alternative. After weeks of shopping and reading and studing, I came across this pool the Intex Easy Set 18-Foot-by-48-Inch Round Pool Set with deluxe maintenance kit and deceided to give it a try. I recieved the pool the day that they said it would arrive. I unpacked it, followed the simple step-by-step instructions on the DVD, and set up my pool(you will need 2 people). It was very easy. I had read some of the reviews and was a little worried that it would not be up to my standards. I was extremely impressed. The pool is made of a thick, durable, tough material. The pump is no where near the powerhouse of the above ground pool pumps that I was used to, but for the price... it works great! I leave my pump running all day and well into the night. The deluxe maintenance kit is a must have, to be able to enjoy your pool all summer long, it has to stay clean and this kit will make keeping your pool clean alot easier on you. If you need a pool to splash around in, and don't have the money or space for a permanent above ground pool, I would highly recommend this pool for you. It also has a few nice features for the safety of children. But..YOU ABSOULETY MUST HAVE A LEVEL SPOT TO PLACE YOUR POOL....OR THE POOL WILL LEAN TO THE LOW SIDE AND WILL NOT FILL UP CORRECTLY."

Got it from Amazon for a little under $400.00 with everything included, pool, ladder, pump, test kit, vacuum, skimmer, all the instructions you will ever need and NO shipping cost.  Couple of tips: Make sure when you set it up, you take time to level the ground under the pool.  We set ours up late in the season and our backyard is flat as a pancake, or so we thought.  We just picked the most likely place and set up the pool (took no more than a half hour, honestly) The ground was not exactly level so one side filled to the rim and the other side did not, so we didn't get the full 48' We decided to leave it for this year and level the ground next year. The pump works great and the chlorine required for this pool is minimal. We may look into the salt water pump for next year. The only thing I would change would be the ladder.  It's fine but hubby is 6'4' and 250 pounds and the ladder is not as stable as I would like.  We may try to find something different for next year.All in all, one of the best purchases I ever made, the grandkids love it.  Ages 6, 2 and 9 months and my daughter and her husband love to visit.  No need to entertain the kids or take them out and spend money.  A few dollar toys, a late day barbeque and life just doesn't get any better.All we need to do at the end of the season is drain it, and put it away until next year.  No winter maintenance!!!Enjoy"

It was a pain to set up at first, when we tried to install it on what seemed to be the level part of our yard. Trust me, no matter how level an area seems to be, it isn't. We took it down and moved it to our concrete patio. The instructions say not to install on concrete, but the Intex website said it was fine as long as a ground cover was used. We set up the pool again to find that our seemingly level patio was far from being level at all. Since it was such a cheap pool, we decided to level it by stuffing some old cushions underneath the lower sides after it was emptied, then we filled it back up. It took a few people and a little effort but now the pool is at near-capacity and swims great!Maintenance:This pool DEFINITELY needs chemicals. The filter is basically useless, except to circulate water around. About 2 weeks after we set the pool up, my husband and I both got TERRIBLE ear infections from the water. Seriously, I had never been in so much pain. My ears bled from the inside and I had an eardrum rupture. I refused to get in the water for 3 weeks after that. Finally we got test strips that tested the Ph, chlorine, alkalinity, etc and got the appropriate chemicals to keep the water clean and healthy.Recreation:My husband and I love it. It's perfect for relaxing in the evenings or for getting a tan. We can both fit full-sized floats inside and relax together. It's also fun to walk around the inside perimeter in a circular path (say, counter-clockwise) and create a sort of whirlpool-like current. When you stop and sit down in the water it pushes you around like a lazy river. It's so much fun! I giggle like a little girl when we do that! Or you can create the whirlpool and try to swim against the current and go nowhere! That's great for exercise and it's fun, too.Durability:Despite being moved several times, drained, refilled, and abused by our concrete flooring, this pool has been quite durable. Even my 2 poodles with long toenails jump up on the inflated ring side and watch us swim, and they've yet to puncture the side or the ring. This is our first year of use, so I am not sure how it will be next year if we keep this one though.Overall:I highly recommend this pool for it's size, price, and fun factor. It's just enough to bring summer smiles!"

We are filling the ring with air about 7 times per day now.  Intex was no help.  We called and emailed them and they just sent advertisements for new pools.  Our pool does not leak water, but the air ring leaks air.  This will be our last year with this pool and I would not suggest anyone buying a pool with an air ring to inflate because the air ring can get very tiny microscopic air holes that cannot be seen with the human eye; so we were told.

For each of the last two years, after I have taken mine out of winter storage, there have been multiple leaks in the ring. Since a properly inflated ring is crucial for this pool, this is a big deal.Third, the pump on the new model has a box on the electrical cord with 'Test' and 'Reset' buttons. This sounds great, but I like to keep my pump on a timer so that it runs at a certain time every day. I can no longer do this, since every time the timer kicks in, you still have to go press the 'Reset' button on the box to turn the pump on.

I run the pump on a timer, 8 hours a day, add about 1 - 3 oz of chlorine granules a day in the hot summer,  shock it after storms or heavy use, and it stays clear and clean.  The directions clearly state that you must set up on level ground.  It will collapse under the weight of the water as soon as a little one leans on an uneven side, so DO NOT USE IT ON UN-LEVEL SURFACES.  We are off aprox 1' from side to side and that is about the most you can go without probs.

The flatter the surface the better.  You can make this work on ground that is somewhat uneven, but it take a lot of work.2) You MUST make sure that bottom of the pool is pulled out to make a true circle.  It is easy to be lazy with this because when there is no water in the pool it can look 'good enough,' but if you have an oval there is a chance that the water will push out and start to flow out once it is filled.3) If you plan to put this away year after year get a ground cloth.  If the pool is on grass the bottom is IMPOSSIBLE to clean.  At the price, I would recommend throwing it out at the end of the season.4) The pump is very basic.  You will need to add chemicals to keep it clean.  Get a net to clean the big stuff out.For the $60-100 price tag you can't really go wrong if what you are looking for is some simple fun and a chance to cool off."

We were a few inches higher on one side so we rented a sod cutter from a local rental place ([price]) - removing the sod from the high side did the trick. 2) Get the wrinkles out of the liner when just 1-2' of water is in the bottom, otherwise the water is too heavy to lift and you can't pull the wrinkles out. 3) Run the filter more than the recommended 3 hours/day. We run it about 8 hrs/day, more in really hot weather. 4) This is an above-ground pool and needs to be cared for as such. Chorine, Ph balance, etc. must be maintained. It only takes 10-15 minutes a day. Consult a good local pool store for advise on cemicals and treatment. It's not perfect, we have a few small wrinkles and the bottom is a bit bumpy, and don't let the kids lean on the sides or there will be a massive waterfall.

I'd heard that other people had it for multiple years and no issues, etc, so we decided to give it a try.  We had it in a very sunny spot, and probably the most level area of our yard.  We had to get a truckload of sand to make it more level.  Was it perfectly level?  No, but it was as close as we could get it.  The caution is to not fill it too high. Also, to just be very careful around the sides.  We had a boy in our pool last summer who leaned too hard on the side and that side collapsed and there as a waterfall.  We were able to get the side back up and fill up again, so it was a warning to all to be careful!  As for the inflatable ring, someone in the reviews had mentioned their poodles jumping off the ring and into the pool and never a puncture.  My thought is that poodles claws might be thicker and duller than cats' claws!  One of our cats refused to come in one night last summer, and the following morning, our pool had completely deflated and drained.  We attributed it to the cat being out all night and he was looking for a drink.  So, what he must've done was put his paws up on the ring, got a 'grip' and pop!  Now, we make absolutely sure that the cats are in at an early hour.  We'll see how it goes this year!  Overall, we were all very happy with the pool.  It was our first time having a pool, so there were some lessons to be learned.  Hopefully we'll have no deflates this summer.  The kids and we had a blast.

This is not going to be a buy once and use for 10 years unless you're lucky. More than likely this will last about three seasons, possibly only two. The material can get holes in it very easily and you can only do so much patching. Now in the first season I usually don't get any, but over time they do develop, especially after drying out and folding away. So if you are willing to look at it as $100 or so a season and can live with that fine. To me I think I'll end up buying 4 of these total, so my investment will be less than two grand for 10 to 15 summers of fun (including salt water system pump and filters) and that is fine with me, but go into it knowing your probably looking at 5 years total if lucky.Do listen to the other reviews, it says level ground for a reason, a slight slope won't work, get as close to level ground as possible or it will fill all to one side and you will have wasted a lot of water as all the water will run out. Tip while filling, every half hour or so if using a garden hose like me, go around and lift the wall, this will keep from water building up over any fold and also keep it filling evenly. Also, don't over-inflate the air ring, it doesn't need to be tight or over-inflated, it doesn't make a difference, and remember heat causes air to expand, a hot day with an over-inflated ring could cause it to pop. 2/3rds to 3/4 of the way inflater does the trick just fine.Now, I do recommend the salt water system for this, it keeps the water clean all summer for me with an initial $19 salt purchase. Plus the bigger pump makes a world of difference and is programmable, definately worth it if you are planning on using these pools for years. Also the solar cover makes a world of difference. I think these are great especially since they come with everything you need but chemicals. Our kids love having it and we use it a few hours a day it seems. So it works well for us, but know what you are getting before purchasing."

Yes, it must be darn close to perfectly level.  We don't allow more than a 1' variance to ensure you don't have leakage problems.  I will say to all those whining about the ring leaks.  First of all, be careful when you handle the pool - it takes a MINIMUM of TWO people to move and handle the pool.  Secondly, they include patches for a reason.  If you have kids or idiotic friends who like to play rough in the pool, yes, you're probably going to spring a leak.  However, it's super-easy to patch (no, you don't actually need to take the whole pool down just to patch the ring but be sure the area is completely dry before applying a patch).  It's VERY simple to find a leak in the ring.  Go around the pool, dunking the ring under water.  You'll see a bunch of air bubbles where there is a leak.  Simply wipe the area dry and use one of the included patches (or you can buy them super cheap online).  Problem solved.  The patches are clear so you really don't see them.  We've only had to patch ONE spot on the pool, which was where a puppy claw had slightly broke through on the ring.  I don't know what people are expecting from a $75 pool, but we've had no complaints about ours.  It's great to come home and cool off on a hot day - even better to hop in after mowing the lawn or doing yard work.  I would recommend upgrading to a better pump, but if you're smart and use a cover, you should have NO problems.  Also, I do recommend using a ground tarp simply because it's a practical way to avoid tearing the bottom of the pool.  Yes, pools are pricy when you add in chemicals and prep items.  IT'S A POOL!  All pools have these expenses.  We highly recommend this pool for those who don't want a huge hassle.  It's waaay better than those stupid kiddie pools and so much easier to deal with.  We took ours down last fall, but we plan to leave it up this year.  A little shock and some chlorine and the pool is sparkling clean!"

I purchased an 8' by 30' pool about four years ago, and used it for a couple of years.  This year we upgraded to the larger 12' by 30' pool, since the kids are getting bigger.  This is one of the cheapest forms of entertainment I can find to keep my kids occupied during the summer.  It may or may not last past this season, but it is worth it either way.  I made sure to put down a ground tarp beneath the pool before I started adding water, this prevents any small rocks and debris on the concrete from puncturing the pool, and makes smoothing out the bottom much easier.  It is also important to have a level surface for the pool.  Mine is on the patio, and concrete is graded away from the house by design.  This 2 or 3 inch drop over the 13' foot width of the patio does not cause any real issue, although it isn't ideal.  The more level you can get the better, but keep in mind concrete patios are always intentionally sloped away from the house.  Check out my 3 photos as well."

"406","XX","B000OR5X1A","5.0","August 23, 2012","A3D5EN5QZ4Y2XY","Great Alternative to In-ground if you do the Setup Right","I didn't buy my Intex at Amazon, but I'm writing this review in an effort to pay it forward since many of the reviews on this site helped me a great deal in deciding to make the purchase and, even more importantly, in providing information about the setup.If all you're looking to know is the bottom line, I can tell you that the pool has been a great success for us, especially for the price. That said, I notice that the price has nearly doubled since I got mine in June of this year (2012), so it would seem that the word is getting out there as to how good these are for the money so we're seeing demand, and therefore the cost, go up.Regardless, if you want more in depth information, I'm going to do this review in two parts; the first talking about the pool, items that come with it, and it's overall functionality and the second part talking about the set up.One thing you should know before you buy is that the size advertised is a little misleading.  Yes, it's 18' x 4' if you're looking at the circumference of the bottom and you're measuring all the way to the top of the ring.  However, when you fill it with water, what you're really looking at is about 15' of water surface area at the top of the pool, and maybe somewhere between 3 to 3.5' of depth... unless of course you fill it to the top of the ring with water, which they don't recommend.  We keep ours filled to just a couple of inches above the bottom of the ring and have zero problems with stability, water, or chemical loss.Remember the 15' dimension if you decide to buy a solar cover, which I highly recommend you do.  I purchased one that was not an Intex brand based on reviews from others who said that the Intex brand solar pool cover was flimsy.  I can't attest to that, but will say that the one that I purchased is great.  We seem to have no water evaporation issues at all.  If anything, we've had to dump water from the pool more than once because it got too full with the rain we've had.  It also does a great job of keeping the pool water warmer, which I like a lot.  I'm in the Virginia Beach area, and my pool temperature has fluctuated between 84 and 92 degrees after the first week or so (it started out in the 70's).  I find 86 to be the ideal temperature for me, personally.  Your mileage may vary, and if it gets too warm, all you have to do is leave the solar cover off for an evening and it will lose several degrees over night.The pool comes with a flimsy ladder.  I'm nearly 40 and the first time I went up that ladder, I thought I was going to fall off and injure myself seriously.  I started shopping for new ladders immediately, but due to cost of a decent ladder decided to wait and see if it would truly be a necessity.  Now that we've had it for a few months, we've gotten used to it.  It's still flimsy, but I'm better at maneuvering on the thing than I was when we first got it.  I'd venture to guess that it would be fine for kids, but not so fine for very over weight or older people.  My mother was scared to death going up the thing getting in the pool and there's no way she'd be able to do it without my assistance.  Just some things to keep in mind.The pool itself seems pretty well constructed.  The lining is thick and the air ring seems to be think enough, but I'm quite certain will probably develop small holes that we'll have to patch over time.  None yet though, thankfully.The pool comes with a filter that seems to work pretty well in conjunction with the salt filtration system I purchased when I got the pool.  Other reviewers highly recommended a salt filtration system.  I can not tell you how happy I am that I decided to listen to them.  We put the recommended amount of salt in when we set the pool up and have only had to add a little bit of salt once.  That's it!!!  That is all the chemical maintenance we've had to do all summer and our water is crystal clear.  In fact, it's some of the clearest pool water I've ever seen. Not to mention that it doesn't have that nasty chlorine smell and we don't get eye burn or bathing suit and tan fading from pool chemicals either.  So, I'll say what many other reviewers said before me, I highly recommend you purchase a salt filtration system when you get the pool.  It does make the up front cost higher, but you don't have to spend loads on chemicals, so it does pay for itself over time as well. I think it's a VERY worthwhile up front investment.It also comes with a skimmer.  We ended up purchasing a replacement skimmer because the one that came with it had pretty large holes and I wanted one with smaller holes in the netting that would do a better job. That's a cheap purchase.  I think we spent $5 or $10 on that. Surprisingly, the vacuum cleaner works better than I expected it to.  Because we keep it covered while not in use, we only have to vacuum it once every other week or sometimes once a week if we have a storm that blows a lot of leaves or debris around.  Even with the cover, some of that will end up in the pool.  We also use a small water basin to rinse our feet before we get in to keep the pool cleaner.One thing to keep in mind is that vacuuming is easier with two people, one to stay inside the pool and do the actual vacuuming and the other to stay outside and dump the vacuum debris bag.  Otherwise, if you're doing it by yourself, you'll have to get in and out a couple of times during vacuuming to dump the debris bag.  In order to keep the suction strong, we typically have to dump it 2 to 3 times for each vacuuming session. It's also a good idea to clean the pool filter during these times.  If you keep that clean, you'll save on filter replacement costs.  We haven't had to replace ours yet.  A simple, but thorough rinse with the hose works for this.Now, to move on to set up.  I don't attribute our success entirely to the pool itself.  I believe the work we put into the pre-setup has a lot to do with how well it's worked out.  We did a lot of that work due to information I acquired while reading other reviews.  So, let me tell you what we did.  First, we put down Ground Clear and killed all the grass and weeds and then cleared the area of all the dead growth.  Next, we dug out a 2-3' pit that became the local pond/bird bath temporarily, but that's a story for another day.  After the pond dried up, we then purchased some weed blocker fabric and about 2 tons of play sand.  We put the weed blocker fabric down and then put all the sand on top of it in the shallow pit.  We then leveled it manually by using a 2x4 and moving that in a circle around several times until the sand height matched the height of the leveling strings my husband had set up around the perimeter.Describing this entire process in a few short sentences here makes this sound much easier than it is to do in actuality.  In actuality, this entire process of prepping the area in this fashion is A LOT of hard labor and took us (primarily my husband) several weeks to accomplish in his free time.  Granted, one of those weeks was waiting for the pit to dry out so we could put the sand in, but it was still a lot of work either way.This accomplished a couple of things for us though.  First, and most importantly, we got it as level as we could and we still ended up an inch or so off.  That's about all the margin of error you have with this pool.  If it's not level, or at least mostly level, you will have serious problems with the pool water spilling out and, very likely, the side of the pool collapsing under the water pressure.  MAKE SURE IT'S LEVEL! I know other reviewers have said that, and even stressed it, but it's so important that it's worth mentioning again.The other thing all our prep work did for us is ensure that we have no weeds or anything whatsoever coming in from the bottom.  If anything grows into the bottom of the pool and damages the pool lining, your pool is toast and Intex does not cover it.  That's in their paperwork, but I'm sure not everyone reads all their documentation all the way through, so I'm hoping future purchasers read this and understand the risk you're taking if you don't ensure that nothing can grow through the bottom.We then put down the blue tarp that came with the pool.  Then we placed the folded pool as best we could in the center.  This requires two people as the pool, even without being filled, is heavy in and of itself.  Not only is it heavy, but it's awkward as well.  We unfolded the pool and had to move it around a few inches to either side to center it.  I think this is where we screwed up some of the sand leveling that we worked so hard to achieve prior to putting the pool down.  Next time, we'll ensure to center it better while it's still folded, rather than just eyeballing it.Once the pool was unfolded, we did our best to straiten out the bottom.  Again, it's heavy and this is harder to do than you'd think.  We then filled the bottom of it with just and inch of water and continued to try to get all the wrinkles out of the lining.  Once even one inch of water is in the bottom of the pool, it becomes 10 times more difficult to maneuver, so keep that in mind.  We continued to work on getting the wrinkles out until we had a couple of inches of water in there.  Finally, we got them all out and left the pool for several hours to fill.  Surprisingly, when we had it all full, there were wrinkles in the bottom again!  No idea how or why that happened, but we think it was simply because the sand compacted underneath and some wrinkles appeared due to that. They're not very bothersome to us, but something like that might bother others. I don't know if/how that's preventable though.  Another lesson learned is that we'll fill the pool less next time and let rain water take care of the last few inches, just so we can save a little on the water bill.Then, after all that work, it was time to enjoy our pool.  Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending how one wants to view it, we had to leave town for a week after we put it up.  Well, it was unfortnate in that we couldn't use it much before we left, but fortunate in that the solar cover did it's job and the pool was in the 80's by the time we got back.  We've been loving it ever since.  My husband and I are typically both 'beach people,' and haven't been to the beach once this summer.  Since we have the pool right outside our back door, there hasn't been a need to lug our beach chairs, towels, cooler, etc. to the beach this year.  We just go out back and hop in the pool any time we want.  We LOVE it and the maintenance with the salt filtration system is far less work than I expected.  Like I said, we've only had to add salt once and vacuum it once every week to two weeks.  What could be easier for such enjoyment?  For the winter, we plan to take the pool down and set up the sand pit as a pretty zen fire area (we have a fire pit for the winter months).So, in summary, I highly recommend this pool.  But, I also highly recommend you do some work setting up the area, that you get a salt filtration system and a 15' solar pool cover to go with it, and you'll be as happy as a fish in his favorite reef for the summer!"

While talking to customer service, she basically went through list of reasons of why it must be my fault. She even asked if we wear sunblock in or around the pool and I said no, but then asked why? She said the these pools develop brown stains on the ring that degrade the vinyl and that holes develop. I explained that was not the case, but I thank her for tip (sarcasm). Any, a supervisor called me back and I explained the defect to him and he politely said 'you are beyond the 90 days and we will not warranty any of it after 90 days and that they had no power to help me in any way because the company and corporate offices in CHINA (which he was wrong, their corporate headquarters are actually in India)have policies against any warranty and or replacement discounts beyond 90 days.

"413","XX","B000OR5X1A","5.0","July 30, 2012","A1ZS60ABT46E7T","If you understand and accept the limitations you will not be disappointed","The cons first - because if you understand them and your setup will work within the limitations, this has been a fantastic pool so far after one month.  Will update if things change.Big Limitation:Yes the ground must be level.  My installation is on a patio that slopes toward the yard for drainage, with a difference in height of about 2 inches from one side to the other.  It still works for me, with the water level being slightly up on the inflatable ring on the low side, and at the bottom of the ring on the high side.Maintenance:Unless you want to regularly refill the 1,500 gallons in this pool (which takes about 3 hours with a garden hose at reasonable pressure) you will need chemicals.  I have never dealt with treating a pool before, but so far it has been easy.  If you take a sample to your local pool store within an hour after collecting it, they can analyze and tell you what you need.  Two things they may recommend that you don't necessarily need: water hardener (why is soft water bad? open to comments...) and cyanuric acid (slows down the loss of chlorine due to UV/sun, if you cover your pool this loss is already greatly minimized).  The only two chemical items I have found that are needed are chlorine and PH adjusters.Some have recommended salt water kits to get away from the chemical cost and maintenance burden.  I believe the salt water kits can be purchased on Amazon for about $150, so you can weigh if this is a suitable option for you.The filter in the filter pump does get dirty and probably should be changed every couple of weeks.  The filter can be taken out and rinsed to prolong life.  The instructions state to remove the circulation inlet and outlet housings inside the pool and replace with the included rubber plugs, although this is a pain due to tight fits.  It is not ideal, but if you work quickly you can remove the filter top, pull the filter and replace the top without losing too much water.  It is a bit tricky to get the o-ring seal back in place but it can be done.  The Type A filters that my included model 603 pump uses vary widely in price online, but I found a 12-pack on Amazon for $36 ($3/filter).  Most in-store sales seem to be about twice that.  Some folks comment online that they 'rotate' their filters, reusing them after they have been cleaned and then dried while using another filter in the mean time.Possible concern:Some others have mentioned that the pump is undersized/fails soon.  So far this has not happened to me.  My pump is rated for 503 gph, so in theory it could filter the entire pool in 3 hours.Installation Tips:Initially do not blow up the inflatable ring all the way. This allows more flexibility in repositioning the ring as the pool is filling.  You MUST keep the ring inside of the base while filling.  It may not be required but I monitored and adjusted during the entire filling process.  I did not do this the first time and had to abort after an hour of filling.Use the blue checkered grid on the inside pool bottom.  This is a great visual aid to check alignment.  As the instructions state, fill about an inch in the bottom of the pool and then use this weight for stability as you move around the perimeter pulling the bottom outwards and tight.  It takes time but you can virtually eliminate all wrinkles.If you install on top of stamped concrete, you will probably want a tarp underneath.  Otherwise the stamp ridges will definitely be felt as you walk in the pool, and at the worst if they have sharp edges might damage the pool floor.If you do only have a couple of inches change in elevation across the pool, it should still work fine.  You will however notice once filled that the pool still 'leans' downhill.  This has not been a problem for us.Highly recommended:A cover.  This keeps out debris and lengthens the life of your chlorine.  Despite negative reviews, the Intex cover made for this size pool (12' x 30') worked great for me.  Just realize that in actual application, it will not look like any of the product pictures.  They show the cover taut across the top, while it actually will be concave and touching the water surface.  It has holes to keep rain water from pooling.  Here is Texas, it acts as quite a heater too so remove it and allow the pool to cool prior to getting in.Bottom line:The above tips may sound like a lot, but in reality they all make much more sense when you are installing and using the pool and will save a lot of time rather than adding.We love it! No leaks.  The water height is above 25' and is perfect for our young ones.  These pool kits can typically be found at local Academy stores for the same price as online.  We just purchased in July 2012 for approximately $85 and feel it is well worth the money.  It does seem like a pain that the product must be returned to the manufacturer and not the point of sale if problems are experienced."

We have a 4 foot intex pool that we've used in the past, but didn't want to put it up this year with our 2 year old running around.  So we bought this one to use now while he is still not the best swimmer.  It says it's a 30 inch, but you can't fill it to the top, so it's probably more like 24 inches deep.  My son is 35 inches tall and it goes a little above his waist.  It's a great size for us too.  We can still float around in it.  We usually have just 2 adults and our son in there, but we've had 3 adults plus our son, and still were able to move around comfortably without bumping into each other.  I've never had any holes or tears with any Intex product before.  Love them!  This does not come with a cover, so I recommend getting one...we have the intex solar cover.  It serves as a cover to keep out debris, but it also helps to keep the water warm and works great.  This size of intex pool also does not come with a ground cloth, so we just used the one that came with our old pool, but you can just buy a cheap tarp from the store to use.  I cannot say how well this pump works because we just used our old pump that came with the 4 foot pool.  We also have the Intex saltwater chlorinator.  It saves us so much money on chemical costs."

I have six rowdy kids that play hard and it did not fail anywhere. Also the pump/filter seems to do a pretty good job. Has a patch kit too.CONS:If you don't use chemicals like chlorine or some expensive natural pool sanitizer ( 35% hydrogen peroxide) for instance, the pool quickly gets kinda yucky.  It lasts about four-six days and needs emptied and refilled.  That takes a lot of water ( over 1,400 gallons for this pool.)  And the biggest issue is taking it down.  Since the kids were bored of it after a couple weeks, I decided to take it down.  That is a headache!  Even once a year.  Once the water is gone it collapses which make a lot of wrinkles and folds that do not dry.  I had to try to hang it up  so it could drip out and finish drying.  Also had to scrub this heavy limp pile of vinyl clean which was a back breaker.  In short,  Think about it really hard before you buy.  It is quite a bit of work to maintain, much more than I thought it would be.  So I say the product seems to be a good product, it is just a pain to take care of."

"419","XX","B000OR5X1A","2.0","July 19, 2012","AOKKY21CAQVGM","Filter Cartridge...","I bought this pool for my four year old because it is an affordable bigger pool, but not too big.  The reviews were pretty good.  The pool is exactly how most people are describing it.  It is actually pretty good, easy to put up and fun once in use.  There are some common sense issues that people seem to overlook, that every pool needs care through chemicals and circulation (a pump), it's inflated (meaning it could pop) and it needs to be put on very level ground.  My issue is with the filter cartridge.  It takes a type D cartridge.  Type D cartridges are difficult to come by.  You are looking at about $20 each and you need to swap them out every 7-10 days.  One cartridge cost about  of the cost of the entire pool.  If you buy a pool, you have to expect to spend for maintenance.  However, I didn't think - but probably should have - that this pool would come with a filter that is that expensive.  The Intex type A and B filters are about two for $10 and they are larger.  These filters are really nowhere.  Amazon has them - one of the few places that does - but they are over $20 for one.  Not affordable.  Should have gotten one of their pools with a pump that runs a type A or B filter cartridge.  This is probably a discontinued filter or pool.  Be careful.  If you have a stockpile of type D cartridges, I recommend this pool for the small kids."

Yes, Intex includes a patch kit and instructions on how to repair (must be a very common problem), but now I have to drain this pool--all 1,400 gallons!--and get some soapy water and find the leak. The seam isn't accessible when the pool is filled, so this is going to be a MAJOR hassle, not to mention all the cost/waste of water and pool chemicals (chlorine tablets and 'shock' add up to $$), in addition to my TIME. Then I have to rinse the pool and refill it, which takes 3 hours. So far, I've just been adding air to the ring before we use it each time, and that means stringing out an extension cord and hooking up my small air pump that's usually used for a camping mattress. Big fun.This should be a fun product, but if the manufacturer doesn't make the product more durable than this, then they can keep it!!

My  brother and sister and I bought this pool with our own money thinking it would be great! We had previously owned a 10 by 30 intex pool, which was okay. When we first used this pool, it worked out okay except for one major problem. When filled with water, the sides of the pool sag down so that it is not nearly as deep as it looks in the picture. I tried to stop this by propping the sides up with chairs and buckets and tables, but the weight of the water made it impossible to stop. Because of this, the pool is more like a big puddle than an actual swimming pool. I am 5'4 and the water only came to halfway between my knee and my ankle when I was standing, and that was when the pool was full. After this, I thought that I might just have to live with it, and it could still be fun. I WAS WRONG! It turns our there was still one huge problem! After storing this pool carefully in our garage for a few weeks, we brought it back out to use for summer. We started to blow up the ring around the top when we began to notice numerous small holes in it! The material that the ring is made out of is very thin, which seems like a major design flaw! We then put ductape on the holes, hoping it would hold. The ductape did stick, but the air would still find a way to leak out! I had to refill the ring about every 5-10 minutes just so  it wouldn't lose ALL the air. This was very frustrating. I then had to leave it over night, and I woke up to find the ring completely deflated! Overall, I would recommend not buying this pool, no matter how awesome it looks and buying the 10 by 30 one instead-which is deeper and a more sensible size. This 12 by 30 pool is obviously meant for people who live way out in the country and have expanses of flat land all around them. I found it difficult to find a good space for it as well, and had to put it in my driveway. Overall, DO NOT BUY THIS POOL!!!!!!"

My pump lasted 4 years before needing replacement, and it sat outside uncovered for 4-5 months each year during the summer.

After reading the reviews, my husband and I are deeply concerned and wanted to get out a safety message! My husband is a class A contractor and we read in some of the reviews that people are placing these INTEX pools on decks! PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS! Even decks built to national building codes are only rated to carry so much weight, and these pools, when filled, weigh THOUSANDS.There was a case recently were a family placed their pool on a deck - they swam and brought the children in to dry off. When they went back out to get the wet clothes, THE DECK WAS GONE! It had crashed from the weight of the pool, and fortunately the children were no longer in it. Please don't risk your and your childrens' lives by placing this on a deck! WOODEN DECKS CANNOT SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF A SWIMMING POOL.I will update on the quality of this pool when it arrives.

After we cut this and that out of the pool and send back to them they will send me another pool.  I'm out the money for the 135 lbs. of salt and the 5,000+ gallons of water.

I liked that one the best, once I got rid of the crappy ladder that came with it - swipe some water on the top ring and just slither over the top, works much better than a ladder, plus it's an automatic child guard - no way for tiny person to climb in alone.  Once filled it's like a kettle, and the water pressure holds it rigid; even while the inflatable top ring sun-rotted the water stayed in pretty much.  The tricky thing with that kind is having no slope at all, otherwise after a hard florida rain it overtops and the low side flips out and you get a flood that digs the ground even lower right there (it's sand not dirt here), but then once it equalizes it flips right back up and sits there looking innocent.  I did get the chlorine generator, so very low maintenance and no adding chemicals, just cleaned filter once a week and vacuumed a few times a year.  The hoses do tend to rot, I think it's a combination of sun damage, salt, and the chlorine that's generated.  Advantage is you can run the generator longer or shorter to adjust the amount of chlorine, but it was never nasty strong like chlorine dumped in from a bottle or tablet.I'm remodeling but once things are settled again I'll get another one of these.  No room in the yard right now, plus stray nails might puncture it, so a little snapset pool will have to tide me over. I might investigate trying to use a pvc pipe instead of the hoses, for durability, if I can find the right connectors.All in all it depends what you want, swimming I'd get large quickset, just cooling off while sunbathing I'd get small snapset.  Having dogs, I wouldn't get inflatable."

Sunday we had a party with lots of kids 12 and under.  They all enjoyed it very much.  Late Sunday it split a bottom seem in lower left (as seen from the back) close to where the pool is.  The seam split is a semi-circle about 4 inches across and is right were two pieces of plastic join. The split quickly leaks all the air from the supports of both the left and right side verticals.  The slide itself, the ladder, the bottom pillow portion in the pool and the two side 'ballons' still hold air but with the side vertical supports deflated the slide won't remain upright.Very disappointed with the product durability and quality.  I don't feel it was being abused or misused.  I think its just poorly designed and prone to this type of failure.  It should be made from a vinyl/fabric similar to the what jumper houses are made of or extra re-enforced along the seams.I might try to patch the split but I think it will happen again quickly.  Or I might try to make some type of new frame and reuse the slide itself since that portion is still good.  Or I might try to 'stuff' some other type of inflatable (maybe car tire inner tubes) into the supports and then inflate those.

After the original one sprung a couple of leaks that we could not locate for repair, we decided to get another one.  The price on Amazon was appealing so we purchased a second one for the 2011 season.  After inflating it for the first time my wife noticed that it had been patched on the left side of the slide (new???).  After inflating the patch held very well.  After the first day of use the ladder portion of the stairs seemed to have a slow leak.  By the second day we located the leak in one of the step holes.  It had actually torn the plastic in a horizontal line.  We are attempting to fix the leak, but haven't been successful to date.  I would not recommend purchasing this item unless you plan for a one time use or as a throw-away after the first season."

I was a bit skeptical to purchase it but there is nothing else comparable on the market and my daughter really wanted this slide.First off, this slide is huge. It takes up a lot of room, so make sure you have plenty of space. It takes a while to pump up, and I do recommend a compatible pump to blow it up. It is impossible to blow it up without a pump. It's just too big. The slide has multiple chambers you have to inflate.The slide seems to be well made and somewhat medium duty. Don't purchase this if it is for older kids. It will simply break. My daughter is 4 and doesn't rough house on it. If you have older children I guarantee this will be broken very quickly. The instructions for the slide aren't that great either.It took me about an hour get this slide inflated and ready to use although I didn't really have a compatible fitting to fill it up. So it may inflate a bit quicker for others. It has held up just fine so far after a few hours of use and about 2 weeks sitting on my pool deck. Since it has been there a little bit of air has escaped and I will have to spend 5 minutes adding a bit of air soon. Besides that it has held up fairly well. I did place a tarp underneath it so it wouldn't grind on my wooden deck. Hopefully it will last the summer and another year. Beyond that I don't expect it to hold up without repairs. I give it 4 stars because it is a ton of fun for kids and provides hours of enjoyment!"

It is sturdy, I love the steps in back so they can hold on as they go down and the kids played all day into the evening on it and with the width of the slide they can do many tricks sliding down.

Used it for 3-4 months without issue before we turn it upside down and use it as a jungle gym in the pool.  Wasn't designed for this, and soon split a seam.  Was impossible to fix.  So we are now on slide #2 with strict instructions - it is a slide only -- and I bought a $39 'Cube' they can use as a floating jungle gym.  So far that solution appears to be working.  No issues now and have been using slide #2 for 3 months.  One tip -- it takes FOREVER to blow up using a standard air compressor.  And I think would be near impossible using just your mouth/lungs.  Instead -- open the quick release valve and use the exhaust of a shop vac to fill it.  Will fill up in 10 minutes versus 2 hours.  My economy $29 bucket shop vac worked brilliantly.Despite the durability issues -- I still give the product 4 stars.  It's a vinyl blow up toy after all -- leaks are going to happen if you aren't careful or are unlucky enough to get one from the factor with a hole.  (Both mine were fine out of the box).

Other reviews complained about developing leaks, but ours did not after about 6 uses so far before the season ended. One observation is the maker did not seem to think their own product would last several seasons since 4 of the 7 air chambers do not have a quick release valve for deflating the slide & storing it. To put it away for the season (or wind storms) it takes about 1/2 hour of rolling around on it to get all the air out & store in a reasonable amount of space. All air chambers should have quick inflate/deflate valves on the next model."

REMEMBER - NO ONE HAD EVEN BEEN ON THE SLIDE!I patched the holes and the kids used the slide 3-4 times in the summer until the next hole started. This hole was not repairable.  It grew to be larger than the size of a quarter and was right on a seam that formed a hard angle.

The first time the kids saw it, they wanted to get right on. When fully inflated, it works great. It has a flap at the end of the slide that extends will into the water so there's no danger of landing on the edge of the pool.At one point, we even put it completely into the pool, which the kids had a good time with. There is a slight danger with that in that a child could get trapped underneath, so do not allow them to do this without adult supervision. Actually, this should only be used with adult supervision.It works best when fully inflated so the center portion is quite hard. Otherwise, the kids will sink in increasing friction and slowing the slide to a crawl. The water sprayers work OK. Keeping the slide wet makes it work better.The main advantage of this over a rigid slide in that it deflates for storage.It's fairly easy to set up if you have a good shop vac. A compressor won't do it nor will a hand pump. The larger sections use Boston valves. With the first cap off, it's a one-way air valve. This makes inflating easy. With the second cap off, it's an open hole, which makes deflating fairly easy. The other sections use a regular flip-top air value with an inside flap. It should make inflating easy, but my shop vac had trouble pushing air past the valve. I had to crimp it with pliers of jam something inside to hold it open. But this was nothing compared to the nightmare trying to deflate those sections. The shop vac merely closes the valve more tightly. I needed the pliers and a lot of patience. Maybe it would be easier if I had a very thin attachment for the shop vac that would go complete inside.It's also difficult to know which sections to deflate first. I ended up doing them all a little at a time in rotation. A real pain. It takes over an hour to take it down and pack it away. I bought a canvas to wrap it is to protect the vinyl. Getting is back into the box is impossible.It worked great the first year. At the start of this year, it already would not hold air. I had to keep inflating it, because if it gets low the kids can't slide. The kids ended up getting tired up it, so I put it away. I doubt that I will get it out again.This is a great idea and a lot of fun when it works. The quality just isn't there."

Unfortunately for us, an adult friend (about 240 lbs.) went down it while he was housesitting and it popped. Our friend was willing to buy us a replacement, so I went in search of the slide again. Amazon doesn't carry it with free shipping anymore, but Target did.I ordered the replacement slide from Target. We blew it up (which takes forever) and hooked it up to the hose to start the spray. After about an hour, turned it off. Did the same thing the next day. On day 3, when we went out to swim, I noticed the slide was sinking into the pool. Somehow the hose water was leaking into the base of the slide! It took 2 adults and several kids to get it out of the pool to drain it. We were lucky that we bought it from Target, because they allowed us to return it for a full refund. The product was, in fact, defective. I would say that if you plan to buy this product, cross your fingers that it isn't defective and buy if from someplace with a good return policy, just in case it is.We are not taking our chances on a 3rd slide and it's too bad because this one really was fun! :("

I am very impressed with the saftey.  It is steeper, which adds for fun, but has great steps for the kids.

The kids and adults really loved it!  My main complaint is that the design of the stairs does not support the weight  multiple  children repeatedly climbing on it and it ripped at the top seam ( step) on the first day of use.  I will replace it when the company has more in stock because as the parent of an only child, I do feel that it will hold up for our small family.  Most products for your pool will only last a couple of summers at best before they need to be replaced, and it is a disappointment that it only held up for one day although the slide itself is still usable.  It really is a fun addition to your backyard pool even so."

I bought this last year and my five year-old and her friends used it all summer.  I inflated it once at the start and didn't touch it again until I deflated it in the Fall.  I bought it with the intention that it would last the year and become disposable but to my surprise, after inflating it again last week, it's working great with no leaks!  Something that is different this year is how air temperature is affecting it.  I didn't experience it last year and it's new for this year but it may be due to the fact that I didn't fill it as 'hard' as last year.  When it gets cold outside, the air contracts and it looks kind of saggy but when it gets to be afternoon it's totally great.  Maybe I'll throw more air in this weekend to keep the shape more consistent.Anyhow, it's a fun thing for small kids.  I don't think I would recommend it for teenagers and for sure, not for adults."

Although I thought we would have been using it before the return window closed on June 8, Texas had a rainy and unseasonably cool late Spring, so by June 8 we had only used the slide once and the water was still pretty nippy.  After only 3 uses, the seam on one side of the slide has completely ripped out -- making the whole thing unusable.  The kids absolutely loved it.  One other point -- in April, I paid $89.95 for this item. Today, it's price is $699.95.  It's my 401k account in reverse!!!"

Right after setting it up, we had a huge storm come through and the slide was blown into a big cactus I had sitting on the deck. It had cactus needles stuck all over it (probably about 20 or so) and I used a spray bottle with soapy water in it to find and patch them all.  We've had little kids use it (3 yrs old) and big kids (200+ lbs) and it has held up well so far.  No one has been overly rough with it (yet), but it is made pretty well.[...]"

I weight 190lbs and I can literally stand on top of the slide without the slightest colapse.  The slide is easy to inflate with a small electric pump.

I bought a small Intex pump at a local store and it worked fine. we didn't have any leaks in it and it held up to abuse by 20 9-year olds.  don't have anyone over 10 use this as it does not hold up to the weight.  we had a 12 year old try to use it and the seam split open after a couple of slides. also a 12in hole opened up at the steps.  had to throw it away.  plan on buying another one for my daughters as they (ages 6 and 9) really loved it.UPDATE:  okay, so i bought another one and it did fine last summer, the first year of its use.  we took it out again this summer and the first time my kids got on there, the seam split again in the same area, by the foot holes.  My now 11 yr old weighs around 55lbs and my 8 yr old weighs 40lbs.  so it seems that the slide is probably best used for children under 50lbs."

The materials are made of heavy duty plastic, not the cheap kind that will puncher easily.  The base kept the slide from rolling sideway and out of the pool.  I am approx 180 bls and was still able to slide down on it.  The kids loved it.The only down side to this product is that it does not come with it's own pump!  You will need to have a pump with two different connectors: one for the normal small blow by mouth that you would typically see for inflable toys and the other is a larger (approx 1/2 inches Bostin valve, spell ???).  I would recommend a portable pump so that you down mix electricty with water!!!!Oh, one more thing.

The fact that products can sometimes get damaged in transit is understandable but the the fact that no-one would assist in a replacement or refund, is totally beyond me.The service we received regarding this product was, quite simply, dreadful!I've been an amazon customer for years and never had an issue - but this time, the product and service was extremely poor."

I contacted several people(at least 10) from Ebay who had bought one and everyone of them said it was a great buy. I decided  to buy it from Amazon. Free shipping and I got a deal if I took out Amazon credit card so I couldn't refuse. It turned out to be a great buy. My grand kids are 8 and 5. We were quite careful with the slide at first but as each day went by the kids got more inventive. They are not heavy kids but they jumped, flipped and anything you could think of they did. I did have them go up the foot holes carefully and the biggest precaution I took was to lay a large very old cotton rug under the slide so it wouldn't get scraped or a hole from the aggregate decking. The kids loved it and now we have let the air out and hopefully we will be able to use it next year? This turned out to be so much fun and we thought the quality was very good so we came back and bought the Intex trampoline. That is awesome also but not for above ground pools.

Then the water stopped shooting out and I could hear it filling up the side bladder of the slide so I quickly removed the hose. Then I heard massive amounts of air leaking out from where the hose attaches. There is no way to stop it coming out. No lid, nothing.

We tend to bring it out for a few weeks at a time, a couple times each summer.  In other words we don't leave it up constantly.  When it is up the kids use it a ton.  Our boys are now 7 and 4.  Lots of neighborhood kids have used it too.The slide has been surprisingly durable the last several years.  We've been pretty careful how we inflate it and haven't let any big kids jump up and down on it. That seems to be the key for an inflatable slide.  If you over inflate it, which it clearly says not to do on the box and on the slide, it will tear at a seam.  You can replace any other tear (of which we've had none) but you really cannot fix a tear in a seam.  Over inflation and letting someone too big jump on it is murder on the seams.The slide has had no problems with the edges of our pool or the rough decking we have.  There have been no problems with the hose either.  This is the first year we've had any problems and it was because I was a bit overzealous with the air hose.I'm buying another."

I had read several reviews about punctures, tears, rips, etc., and I was obviously concerned that we would get their hopes up to only have them deflated (pun intended) by a poor quality product that wouldn't make it through the weekend much less the rest of the summer.  So far, there does not seem to be anything that I worry about with kids our age.  However, the weight limit on this product is 175-lbs.  My husband is right at that mark and he tried a face-first belly slide down into the pool.  We could definitely see how repetitive use by heavier sliders could cause rips and tears, espcially on the side where you climb up onto the slide, so he brought a chair over for him to step on for the next few attempts instead of climbing up the slide itself, and we were much less concerned.  All-in-all, we are very satisfied with this slide, but are exercising care and caution for heavier riders and are sticking to the rule that if you are over 175-lbs, you are not allowed to slide...unless you want to buy the next one!  Great summer fun at an affordable price!"

I didn't read the reviews before i bought him, but after i did i read them and they say that he is no bigger then their hands well they must have some huge hands then. because it is a great size. i wish it would say that it was plastic though. and i hope that it doesn't turn grey like others are saying. other then that it's a great gift. very cute."

It's much better than just an orange safety flag and it's actually less expensive (on Amazon).The difficulty I had with this one is the six wings do not fit evenly into the rotating discs on the horizontal shaft.  One disc has six holes, but the other has eight.  If the wings are not spaced evenly, the rotating assembly is unbalanced.  But I could not balance them evenly when there's six little fiberglass rods to stick into eight holes around the circumference of the disc.  I did not have this problem with the 'Bee' model which has four wings instead of six.  I suspect the one I received was incorrectly assembled with a 8 hole disc instead of a second 6 hole disc.My expecatation was tempered by the price.  This thing is made with low-cost labor in China, but the design and materials are fair for what it costs.It spins and turns nicely.  It's made of nylon that I would expect might last two years in the sun but I don't expect to use it in the yard myself."

"828","XX","B004J6DIO6","4.0","June 30, 2013","A3JD60HT2CAJNL","Easy assembly with a few issues","First props to Amazon, item came a day early. Props to Char-Broil as it was very well packaged and instructions were very good with some places for improvements.  In spite of the packaging one of the 2 grills was pretty badly bent with the black coating (?) badly chipped away leaving the bright metal exposed. It was easy to bend back into approximate shape but the coating problem persists.  I have not yet contacted the Char-Broil as I finished assembly literally moments ago.I did the assembly alone and did not need any help except where my man hands had some trouble holding onto a nut.The instructions include a parts diagram with each part having a letter designation (A,B...) but no names. These descriptors are never used in the instructions, just the names of the parts. In spite of this issue assembly went well.  I'll focus on where I had problems or went wrong.Step 5 is the ignitor which is provided with a stamped nut . I found it a bit tight to fit my hand in and tighten the nut. I could do it, just didn't like it.  I suggest before you insert the igniter recognize that it has two wire connectors; one  on the bottom to ignite the main burners and one on the side to ignite the side burner.  If you don't notice this you might be puzzled when it comes time to connect the side burner.I also had a little trouble with step 4.  The instruction words are clear but I had the wrong mental picture in mind. Each tank exclusion wire goes from a  front leg to the the opposite side bottom side piece.  Rereading the instructions I don't know why I had a problem with this step, but I did it wrong the first time.Step 6 I tightened the stamped nuts on the side shelf before attaching the wing screw. It took a little force to line up the wing screw so I loosened the other screws and was more easily able to use the wing screw.Step 7 (sideburner). I am surprised how the side burner and sideburner valve fit together.  I expected a gas tight connection whereas the sideburner gas delivery tube just goes inside the sideburner.Might attach the propane later today and fire it up.I like the way it looks, feels sturdy enough.  Makes me look forward to grilling out.Update July 3 2013.  Attached propane and fired it up. Everything worked great. Even used the side burner.  Very happy with puchase. I do plan to contact char-broil to get a replacement grill with coating fully intact."

First, the screws that hold the side tables to the main frame are difficult to access with a screw driver but it was manageable.  Second, the instructions for connecting the side burner wire to the electrode are very deficient.  Eventually I did figure out that the wire goes on the little metal flap on the igniter. After completing the assembly while still in the garage the igniter did spark but after moving the grill to the patio it no longer would spark.  I like most other people don't really care because typically after a couple of months we all end up using a match to light the grill.  Which brings me to the idiotic match holder provided with the grill.What genius decided to locate a chain with a 'match holder' above the propane tank, underneath the side burner table?  To get the match into the grill you have to get under the side burner table, attach the match to the stick and push it through a hole in the side of the grill while trying to turn on the burner.  Just get a fireplace match and stick it through the grate, down next to the burner and ignition will occur.Finally the location of the propane tank is a bit obnoxious.  It is less than attractive and not very easy to properly hang the tank off the hook while getting the bottom of the tank in the correct location.  With three dogs I am not happy that the bottom of the grill is not enclosed but you get what you pay for.On the plus side the grill does work and should be good enough for the basic grilling of hot dogs, hamburgers, steak and sausage.  Last night I whipped up a bunch of hamburgers and they came out fine.  Tonight we are trying sausage.  Hopefully this grill will last two years until I can afford the Weber with the rotisserie that I have my eye on."

As noted in other reviews, many parts will arrive damaged.  . That's your first sign of trouble.  The box showed some shipping damage, however the damaged parts did not seem to be part of the box damage.  Like another reviewer noted, it appears to have been shipped by Char Broil in this condition.Char Broil's website indicates 'No Tool Required' because parts are hooked onto loosely pre-installed screws.  The enclosed guide book ends the first step with the instruction 'Tighten the screws.'  Apparently the Char Broil people and the instruction guide people are unrelated.  'No tools required' actually means at least a phillips head screwdriver.  I would also suggest:  hammer, rubber mallet, scrap 2' x 4' about 18' long, pliers (several) and vise grips. Your parts will not easily snap together as designed. I also recommend a can of black paint to retouch the parts you will damage with your hammering.  You'll need all of these, maybe more, to wrestle the parts together.Initial test seemed OK with good heat.  It works, burns hot, but is very unstable. Don't plan on moving this one around the patio.

I had read that quite a few people had damage/problems encountered during shipping, and luckily didn't have any serious problems.  I did notice a couple of minor dings and a chip out of the paint (right on front by the knobs, of course!), but overall no problems.Assembly was VERY easy, only requiring a phillips head screwdriver (need a long one for a couple) since it came with all of the screws preset, and just needing tightened after the pieces are slotted together.  The heating grill tends to pop out of the predrilled holes in the lid so watch out for this.Cooking: Very good.  I made burgers, hot dogs and shishkabbobed veggies and they came out perfect.  This baby gets hot btw, much more so than my old grill so watch out for that.  The cooking surface keeps the food in place well, and spread the heat just right.Cleanup -EASY!  The cook surface is easy to lift out and can be cleaned right in the kitchen sink - very convenient.Quality - Just what I expected for the price.  Not saying that this is a bad thing, I just will have to be mindful of this.  I am not expecting to take it camping or move it around much, so not really concerned about this.  It does wobble a bit when I wipe it down, but a supporting hand takes care of this.Overall, very happy with this purchase.  I grill for a family of 4 and haven't really had a backyard bbq for a big group.  Having said that, it is not a very large grill, so if you grill for parties larger than 4-6 you might want to go a bit bigger.  For my needs this one is perfect.  4 stars just cause I like it alot, but just started using it.  Hopefully, I'll be adding a 5th star down the road."

I have had other lower-end Char-Broil grills but nothing as cheaply made as this. The supports and frame barely hold up the grill and with the tank on, it seems to be straining the frame & is a bit wobbly.On the good side, it was easy to build and works fine.

If I can assemble it, so can you!!","I held off from buying a grill for at least 4 months as I did research about which of the grills in my price range was the best fit for my needs. When I decided on this one, I was still a little worried because of the mixed reviews. My biggest concern was the assembly and the ignitor issues that so many people seemed to have... I am NOT at all mechanically inclined and I HATE reading directions and assembling things. My boyfriend and I assembled this together (oh and he fits into the same aforementioned categories as myself) Knowing our weaknesses, we took the time to go through and make sure we had all of the parts prior to starting. We also took a picture of the itemized parts page so that we could refer to the pic on the ipad for that list instead of flipping the directions back and forth. It took us maybe an hour at the most to assemble this after we had done the parts inventory. We didn't have any issues with the ignitor but I can see where someone might not be able to identify where the second ignitor 'thing' (from the side burner) goes because it fits onto such a small little piece but if you look hard enough, its there. Apparently you have to hook up the side burner ignition in order for the mail grill burners to work.Happy with this grill and have used it a few times already. It also looks great, no cosmetic issues here."

"867","XX","B004J6DIO6","4.0","April 7, 2013","A2SD23RN19J0UV","Gets plenty hot for the price","Background: I purchased this grill for a vacation property, where it would only be used certain times of the year. I didn't want to spend a lot of money and the price was right.Shipping & Assembly: I didn't have any damage to the grill once I opened the box. Assembly was easy, it took about 45 minutes and the instructions were pretty clear. Lots of packing material to throw away once you are done with the assembly, but I think it was packed well.Preperation: The grill lives in a saltwater environment close to the water. I sprayed the whole thing down with non-stick spray, then wiped off the excess. I don't know if this will help all that much, but it seemed worthwhile. I store it in the garage when we're not there, but the sheet metal is not very thick gauge and even if it were, nothing metal really survives very long in that environment. If I have to replace it in 3 or 4 years that's fine for the price.Cooking: This grill gets hot! Very important for searing and preventing sticking to the grates. I don't know how accurate the lid thermometer is but it does hit 600 degrees quickly at about 70 degrees air temperature. It actually gets so hot that the grates distorted a bit. That doesn't bother me too much, I can replace them if necessary and they are thin stamped metal. I mostly cooked fish on it. I coated the grates with some vegetable oil and then added the fish. Important not to touch it for a while, on any grill, so it can sear and not fall apart when you either flip it or rotate it 45 degrees for grill marks. I also cooked a pork tenderloin, starting with direct grilling to sear it then shut off a burner and cooked it indirect for 20 minutes or so. It was perfect. I know some people never use a side burner and consider it a waste, but I use mine. If you have a cast iron skillet it works wonderfully for fajitas, gets the pan screaming hot. I used it to cook blackened redfish, you would never want to do that on your kitchen stove unless you want a huge mess and smoke all over the place.Summary: For a grill at this price, that gets as hot as it does, I'm completely satisfied. I have several grills and obviously charcoal is the preference, but if you want something that is fast and convenient I think you'll be happy. My only gripe was that there were no hooks to hang utensils, so I just bought a couple at the hardware store and screwed them to the front panel with stainless screws."

I even had it shipped to my work to be able to do this. As many reviews have stated the grills arrived in bad shape from the get go. Even with the box in good shape there were some parts that were still a little bent but nothing that couldn't be fixed easily. Since I an mechanically inclined it only took me a little under an hour to put the grill together. In my opinion it was pretty easy. I will say that there were one or two places that the direction were lacking information. But I was able to figure it out. All in all I believe that almost anyone would be able to put one together. I think the only tool I need was a philips head screwdriver. MOST of the screws were in place already and all you have to do is just tighten them. I will also say that there were a couple of screws that were hard to get to when putting the side burner and the other side tray on. A longer handled screwdriver would have made this part easier. I light the grill and let it burn on high for 20 minutes like the direction said. All the burners lit and the thermomator worked fine. Tommorow I will use the grill for the first time.

I had been looking for two month unsure which grill to get so we settled on the Char-Broil 36,000 BTU 3-Burner Gas Grill, 522 Square Inch with Side Burner. Got it home the legs did not fit on the cart, we called the company they said they would send out the correct legs no charge. Then we went to fire it up and the igniter did not work but we lived with that because we had been do a manual light with the old grill for years. We had to heat the grill up to burn off the factory coating, when my husband went to open the lid he also got 2nd degree burns on his hands- we had to use the 'Ove-Glove' to open and close the lid. When we called the company, they said there was nothing they could except to use a mitt when touching the grill. Finally, we were cooking for the 3rd time and the warming tray above the grill folded down onto itself sliding what I had on the tray onto the grill itself. The last straw was the fact the grill did not cook the food any better than the old grill we have had for well over 20years. I say do not buy this grill. We returned to the store that we had purchased at and for an additional $200 hundred dollars we purchased a Weber, the lesson we learned is to not to rush into a purchase."

The grill size is PERFECT for us (2)seniors, but would serve equally as well for a family of 5 or a gathering of 8 with little effort. The directions were very explicite, both in word & picture, thus no problem putting together as long as you FOLLOW the numerical steps! The 3 burners allows the choice for cooking for 2 or multiple, utilizing the propane most efficiently. Every meat we have cooked has been perfectly evenly & thoroughly cooked, coming out tasty(per ur seasoning)tender, & that stay warm rack is really helpful. The grill surface is 2 easy to remove panels to make it extremely easy to keep clean. we even put them in the dishwasher. The ONLY negative is when moving the grill, but I think most are this way. The wheels make moving easy enough, but there is no specific handle to use to lift the non-wheel end to move, you lift by the serving tray, which would make it awkward moving it any distance or rough terrain..But ours lives in one spot, & is of no consequence to us, whatsoever!

Seriously there is a small hand full of screws... I guess keeping it simple for those who don't have tools or cant read... But again - I can live with this as I can brace the bottom and sides easily enough if I feel the need.. The overall casting is like stamped steel vs cast or pot, it makes it light weight but feels flimsy..Now PROs and what-nots..As far as use: I have grilled just about everything; burgers, dogs, chicken, steak, chop, fish and corn as well as more...The grill heats up fast, and does cool down fast...Its not so much a 'set it' and 'forget it' deal, you better stay close till you get the feel of her. You can cook up the outside of the meat and not of touched the insides; great for steak, not so for chicken...Like I said, its not a set it and go on, High is good for the initial heat up, and when the meats on, you'll be adjusting to find that sweet spot...The grill surface is the wider slats not the wire, I have been wiping off with a rag, before and after - a wire brush I think will mar it up, I also use Veg spray to cut down on the sticking, its a needed... Side burner again heats up fast and I like the flush lid, makes a usable self.All in all for the price, I cant complain... I would like to of seen it more rigid, it probably won't last as long as my previous 2 (this is my 3rd in 12 yrs). But I know this going in, so if it lasts 3yrs @$150 that $50 a year spent (that's about as much as the gas).

I had problems with ground squirrels getting into my grill and tools. All I could find at various big boxes were monster contraptions costing many 100's of $$$. So when the 463722311, catchy model name, showed up on one of the bargain sites for $94 shipped, I jumped on it.THE GRILL:Fundamentally this is a very solid gas grill with flaws in design of the support frame and numerous quality issues getting a perfect product to the customer. The basic gas grill was preassembled and it slid into the frame you assembled from the many parts using a well-illustrated manual. Both the top and bottom of the firebox were heavy gauge steel shells. The burners, tent flame shields, upper wire shelf and grill racks are then inserted inside the shells, all exhibiting a been there - done that before professionalism. All the steel pieces were coated in porcelain, easy to clean and durable. I've yet to fully master all the subtleties of grilling on the 463722311, but I'm convinced that with the thermometer and 3-burners it won't take me long.* Since I started using the 463722311 2-months ago I've grilled steaks, chicken, brats and burgers at least twice each and the combination of the three independent burners and the thermometer allows  repeatable control. Some things just need fast grilling whereas other need baking. I always grill in the center with a single grate, this allows me to move the grilled item over the flame tent, away from direct flame. I then adjust the outer burners for the interior temperature. Easier to do than explain.STRUCTURE:The frame that supports the firebox lacked basic structural elements to prevent parallelogram collapse on the right side. A simple triangular brace is all that would be required. Instead, Char-Broil wasted three pieces of wire to exclude a propane tank from being placed under the firebox. Any of those three wires could have braced the frame from collapse. I added a steel strap, crude but functional, see photo.DAMAGE:The grill had numerous dents, dings and bends in many of the thin gauge steel parts. The worst dent was in the upper firebox shell. It had a large dent from the inside out. It's as if someone took a ball peen hammer with full force struck the shell. The dent fractured the porcelain coating inside and out. In addition, the control panel was heavily scuffed in the right corner leaving a thumb size area with the paint removed. Everything was well packaged in cardboard and/or Styrofoam. The outer carton had almost no damage when it arrived. None of the packaging material showed any damage. All this leads me to believe that the damage occurred prior to shipment and were packaged that way by Char-Broil.IGNITOR:The piezo crystal push button ignitor didn't work. I saw one blue spark in one hundred attempts. I used the interactive PDF ignition questionnaire and ended up at the 800 number. I called customer service and except for the accessory up selling the process was smooth and painless. New ignitor should arrive in a week. Installing it into the tight space above the gas manifold will be non-trivial.* After receiving the replacement ignitor which also didn't work, I figured out the problem. I assumed that the ignitor had two parallel circuits for the side and main burners . . . wrong. The two electrodes are in series. By not installing the side burner, I defeated the ignitor function, I should have grounded the side burner wire to the frame.MORE:While the 463722311 has no designed in tool storage, I had no need for a side burner, so I converted that compartment into tool storage, see photo. I purchased a 1/8' pipe plug to block the gas port for the side burner. The propane tank has a hook and v-notch attachment over the axle, quick and simple.I deducted 2 stars for the defective ignitor, weak structure and all the damage. The 463722311 could have easily earned 5 stars except for those problems. My spell checker likes igniter, but Char-Broil spells it ignitor in their manual?*Edit 2-15-12 I bumped my rating one star."

It was very fixable with pliers or a hammer. Everything came together easy and fast. I can't believe how awesome this turned out to be. my husband loves to have a temp gauge on his pits and this has one. The side burner is nice and simple.

I was on the verge of buying another grill that looked great from a big box when I noticed the difference with the Weber. Weber has a high angle heat diffuser that allows grease to run quickly off while the other grills had flatter diffusers over the burners where grease catches on fire and burns the food.

The sear station works like a charm and the burner configuration works for both direct and indirect cooking.  I've used the Weber veggie tray accessory and several cedar planks for fish & other dishes.I ordered this on Amazon to save a little coin from the big box stores with the trade off of having to assemble it myself.  It took about 3 hours for me to get everything together with the care and attention deserved of something that will be on my deck and on fire.  The instructions were clear and the parts are sturdy.  I like the fact that if something breaks I will know how to disassemble and can send to Weber for replacement.Only nit that I want to pick is the plastic holders for tools on the side are a bit large for some grill tools i had at home.  I suggest getting the Weber brand  accessory pack so everything fits the dimensions.  After shelling out for the grill you might as well get the matching set."

My husband did win a bet with his buddies and got the Weber together in 2 1/2 hours. The grill looks great- we love the stainless steel and it was worth the extra money.The only complaint we have is that there was a small dent on one side of the grill.

Not sure if the minor damage occurred at the factory or during the delivery.We would buy this grill again and would recommend it to our friends.

What are the odds that this one person was too cheap to buy this Weber and now is having many second thoughts about their poor decision and feel it necessary to trash an absolutely wonderful grill because they made a stupid mistake. I love this grill! I have always had Webers and I know their superiority over anything else out there. They are quality built and they last forever. The Weber I am replacing is a Genesis Silver B which I've had for over ten years with a ton of use. A friend recently divorced and I gave it to her since her ex took their grill. Actually, it was a great excuse to upgrade to the new EP-330.I selected the little known 'gray' enameled color. The packaging was top notch and the assembly was a snap, about 2-3 hours. It's good for you to put it together yourself as you will see the quality of the parts and feel a great sense of satisfaction in your accomplishment. Why let some part-time teenage boy at the box stores have all the fun. Assembly is fool proof and you'll know it's done correctly!  I have my grill hooked up directly to a 250 gal propane tank so I don't have to fool with the small bottles, but it works equally well with either setup. The grill heats up quickly and maintains a steady temperature throughout the grilling process. The sear burner is great for steaks and the grill is large enough to easily use indirect heat techniques. My steaks, ribs, chops and chicken come out perfectly every time.As the old saying goes, 'You get what you pay for!' It is certainly true with a Weber! Spend a few extra bucks and get a top of the line grill that will give you many satisfied years of outdoor fun. Did I say, I love this grill?"

Up to 700 degrees in five minutes. Indirect works awesome. Overall, the experience of grilling is the best I've had on this grill. BUT, assembly is another thing. We were mising a few parts, For an american made product, the instructions look like a very poor comic book, and, many of the machined parts don't match up. That's ok, with patience and a helper, we're talking four hours to set up, it's done. I went to my local BBQ Galore store, price was the same (not including sales tax) but it did not include set up either.You cannot go wrong with this grill, once it's set up.

After my last 'stainless steel' grill from the local Home Improvement Depot rusted and fell apart after 2 summers of use (covered, inside my screened in porch, and I found out that I could no longer get parts for it...), I decided I was going to do more research before buying my next one.Originally I purchased a Kenmore. Everyone knows they make quality stuff right? All stainless steel, stainless still grates, sear station.. the works. Well I got the thing home and quickly found out why this $500 grill was on sale and so back it went.After some more grill searching, I finally decided to bit the bullet and purchase my first Weber and I am VERY HAPPY that I did!Yes, this grill is at least 2x the cost of the other grills I have been considering, but given that most everything in it is a min of a 5 year warranty and some parts are 10 years, I figure this will last at least 2-3x longer than the others grills.As for the one and only 1 star review.... I fired mine up last night and within 10 minutes it went from off to 700 degrees F! I threw 4 16oz New York Strips on the searing station and ended up with 4 perfectly charred medium rare steaks in about 8 minutes. How can you ask for better?This grill comes packaged so well, they even take the time to put protective tape on every piece of metal in the grill including screw holes! The attention to detail is amazing! The grill went together like a dream. Feels like it is built like a tank and every piece of stainless feels like thick solid 'REAL' stainless steel.I also purchased some of the Weber accessories and they all fit perfectly on this grill as if they were custom made for it.

I had gone to various local stores to actually see the grills. The reason I got the Weber Genesis S-330 was because:  1) I wanted a Weber  2) I wanted the side burner and  3) I was particular about getting the stainless steel option.  At first I got this same grill from my local Lowes since I was not sure about putting it together myself if I got it from Amazon. But before I had received the grill from Lowes, Amazon had this great offer of 20% off all grills. So I asked Lowes if they would match the Amazon price of $760 (after 20% discount from $949) and they said 'NO' since Amazon was an online retailer and Lowes does not price match Amazon. So much for their slogan of 'Nobody beats are price. Nobody'. So I was not happy about it since I paid $949 + tax, whereas I could get it for $760 even from Amazon. So I cancelled my order with Lowes and ordered the Genesis S-330 from Amazon. I received the grill within 5 days (I chose the free economy shipping option).  Now for the putting it together part. At first I thought I would never be able to do it. But the instruction in the Weber manual are clear. They have color coded screws so that we don't make mistakes and had step by step instructions. I have never put a grill together before and I was able to put it together in less that 2 hours and fire it up to test it. Everything worked great and was ready for the long weekend. The first thing I made were some lamb kabobs. Hmmm they were tasty.  I would definitely recommend the Weber to anyone looking for a grill. It's worth the price. Also if you do a little research you may get a good deal like I got from Amazon rather that blindly buying from a local store.

It was a joy to put together and feel the quality of the hardware.  Even the packaging was done very well.Amazingly even heating throughout the grill area with the moderately high temperature you get at maximum being perfect for most grilling.  Grills bars and warming rack are well constructed.  The grill bars have enough heat capacity to give your steaks nice char marks.  I am thrilled Weber finally moved the knobs on the Genesis series to the front so as to not waste valuable shelf space.  I'm also very happy the burners now run front to back to help facilitate indirect cooking.  Casters rolls smoothly.  And the Sear Station helps fix the main issue with propane grilling, the challenges of searing a steak.  This grill sears steaks very nicely.  No major flare ups, grease is handled well.  Electrical ignition continues to work, we'll see how many years that lasts.  I don't use the side burner, so I can't comment on it.Quibble: The bulk of the stainless steel is magnetic, which typically means it is less resistant to corrosion than most non-magnetic stainless steels. When I've had salty water left standing on the shelf, I have noticed faint rust colored discoloration.The handles and grill are constructed from non-magnetic stainless (that's a good thing).  I think the sides of the cooking shroud are made from aluminum as is the cook box.  I'm guessing aluminum because they seem painted, are non-magnetic, feel lighter than cast iron would, and the owners manual talks about aluminum castings (25 yr warranty) which are painted (2 yr warranty on the paint).  Anyhow I can see aluminum being a good choice for those.Minor quibbles: The device to tell you how much propane is left (a very basic spring scale) is a bit gimicky, imprecise, and depending on the tank you are using may be challenging to hang a tank on it.  The good news is you don't have to use this holder.  The front doors don't feel as substantial as I think they should and the magnetic catches holding the doors closed are a little weaker than I'd prefer.  Like I said, pretty minor.As many of the reviewers say, you probably don't need the stainless model, even more so if they are using less corrosion resistant stainless.Anyhow, it is a great grill.  I just wish it didn't carry such a premium price."

(don't forget to cook off for 20 minutes of so before you do your first food)The quality of manufacture is excellent.  All the holes line up and the instructions are very accurate. 4 small screws for the side burner were missing, but they are extremely common and I had some of my own that worked fine. Once put together it's a solid unit.Note:  This is a 'mostly' stainless steel grill.  The base is painted steel.  Almost nobody makes an completely stainless these days except for very expensive units.As others have mentioned this uses a 1/2 gas line connection. It includes the hose and quick disconnect to install to your gas line.  I'm glad that they included both the male and female parts of the quick disconnect.

The control on the heat is very good and the sear burner does an excellent job on steaks by providing that extra heat you need.Consider buying a few magnetic hooks or accessories when you get the grill. I have and it has been really handy to supplement the built in hooks.My only complaint is that the side burner ignition button doesn't ignite the burner.

I have always used charcoal, never thought gas could ever compete with the taste of a charcoal grilled steak.  Boy was I ever wrong.  I researched many gas grills, and based on other customer and industry reviews, I decided on a Weber.  As an Amazon Prime Member, I received a 20% off discount by email, this along with Amazon's incredible low price and free shipping, brought the $1,000+ price to $758.00 delivered!!!  It took, my wife, my son and I about 30 minutes to assemble it.  Would have went faster if I followed the instructions (oh well my eyes are getting worse and I could not read the print-that's my story and I'm sticking to it) and got a socket rather than use the supplied wrench.  I am proud to admit the only mistake I made was putting the locking wheels on the back.  I did change the wheels around though.  I wish I would have caught this before I had it all together.  This thing is HEAVY. For our first meal, I grilled my family a 1 1/2 inch ribeye steak dinner, green beans and corn on the side burner. Incredible. The grill pre-heated very quickly.  It was 550 degrees in less than 10 minutes. As soon as the steaks hit the stainless grilling surface, I was in grill-master heaven. When the juices landed on the flavorizer bars, the aroma was sinful.  I have never smelled anything so incredible since the first time I caught a wiff of my wife's Sweet Honesty perfume when we first started dating 33 years ago (BTW this meal was for our 28th anniversary)! For the first time ever in over 20 years of grilling, the steaks looked exactly like the picture on a fine steak restaurant's menu.  The cross-hatches grill marks and crispy caramelized outside were picture perfect.  However without a doubt the taste of this steak was the best I have ever eaten.

Received the S-330 just over a week ago and can find nothing to say other than it's the best I've seen in this size grill, bar none. Everything - every fitting, every part - is first class.Assembly is straight forward, though a bit time consuming, but I enjoy 'putting things together', as my wife says. It is heavy, but one average male can complete the assembly process. I did, no problem. The delivery company, ABF in my case, couldn't get their truck into our gated community, so I met him outside the gate. He and I loaded it onto my pickup. It weighs almost 200 pounds, but the box is huge and allowed me to slide it off the tailgate, stand it on its end, then I just laid it down flat and slid it into the garage where I assembled the grill. No big deal. Once on the casters, I was home free.The sear burner does steaks the way steak should be. Wouldn't be without it. And the side burner is really handy, often negating in house cooking altogether. I like that. We have a covered patio which will keep it completely out of Florida's weather; I can see this thing lasting forever with a few internal parts replaced a few years down the road. It's built like a tank.Purchase the Weber 7519 Gas Grill Rotisserie - it's a must have. Be careful. Amazon is a bit ambiguous describing Weber rotisseries. The 7519 is the only one which will work with the Genesis 300 series. Learned that the hard way.Buy it, you'll love it."

I love to grill and I live in New England and I am the guy who shovels a path to his grill after a snowstorm.  A few years ago I bought a Weber Smokey Mountain was very impressed at the quality.  Thick gauge steel, very well designed, and easy to use.  So when I decided to get a new grill I knew it would be a Weber and I wanted something that would last me 10 years plus.  I would rather spend more money now than to rebuy something new a few years later.  This lead me to the Genesis S330.  I wanted stainless because more to avoid rot than for the aesthetics (it is a good looking grill) and I needed one with a side burner.  I have a glass-top electric stove in my kitchen and the side burner will let me use my cast iron pans for certain recipes.  Plus I can cook beans at cookouts, corn on the cob, lobster, etc. without going back and forth to the kitchen.It was extremely well packaged, read the instructions when you unpack it because it also tells you where each part is in the box so it is easier to put together.  Its also heavy, in the range of 180 pounds, and I was alone when it arrived.  So I skipped that step and took the pieces out into the backyard bit by bit.  It took me longer to put together but my back was much happier.  Assembly took about 3 hours with me taking my time to make sure I put it together right.  A few parts are easy to install backwards so retrace your steps if something isn't fitting right.Cooking on the grill is nothing short of amazing.  It heats up fast and the sear station is excellent.  I cooked filet mignon to the perfect medium rare by turning on all burners and using the sear station to high.  Put the steak over the sear station and cook for1 1/2 minutes, rotate 90 degrees (for diamond grill marks), cook for 1 1/2 minutes,  flip and sear for an additional 3 minutes.  Next turn off the sear station and middle burner, move the steak to the center of the grill and cook for an additional 3 minutes (indirect heat.)  Rest for 5 minutes.  It had an awesome crust, great texture, nice and juicy.  Better than what I can get at most restaurants.If you are thinking about spending the money on a good grill I would go with the Genesis 330.  If money is an issue check out Weber's Spirit line.  Either way you really can't go wrong with a Weber product."

The front-to-back burners in the newest model make it so easy to cook with either direct or indirect heat and this thing can heat like no other...especially on the side with the sear burner.  You won't regret your purchase...and you still won't regret it 10 years later.  I got tired of recycling cheap imitations.  The Genesis is still made in America (the lower line of Weber is not any longer) and you can tell the difference.  Very hefty and well built.  Go for it.  It's a lot of money, but you will thank yourself every time you open the lid to cook a great meal...and if you're like me...that's 3-4 times a week."

Assembly not complicated, but one part is heavy enough that it takes 2 people.  Lid is heavy and does not have a counterbalance weight to help with opening; this can make for a long day with lots of lid opening and closings. Grease trap not large enough for a LARGE, slow cooked, brisket and roasts.PROS - Heavy; holds heat and is not going to fall apart (appears to be quality design / parts).  It appears that Webber has addressed the 'rain in the grease trap' problem that other reviewers commented about.  This may have been addressed with the new grill design (gas controls on the front and not on the side).  Comes with a gas cylinder gauge that works better than anything I have had in the past. Does a good job minimizing flare-ups. SS cook grate is heavy duty and easy to clean.Other notes - Get the top of the line Webber grill cover to protect your investment.  I also like the grill lights that attach to the lid handle because I do a lot of cooking at night and during short, but mild, winter days (I love the Texas Hill Country!)"

The grill arrived via freight and was wheeled onto my deck.  Installation took approximately 1 hour (including unpacking and getting rid of trash) and was quite simple (make sure you have a phillips head).Just grilled the otehr night for the firs time and the grill was fired upin no time.  So far the purchase has been great. Maneuvers around all over the deck since it is on wheels, locks into place when I need to use it.

We replaced our 10-year old smaller Weber gas grill only because we wanted a larger model.  The old grill is going to our nephew and is still in great shape.  This is what you get when you buy a Weber.As for the new way of cooking, we have followed the instructions in the barbecue book that came with it, and have not been disappointed.  No more burnt, dried out food.  The first night my husband made chicken legs and they came out perfectly with the recommended indirect method.  By far the best grilled legs that I ever had.  Juicy, crisp, and cooked all the way through.  Last night I made burgers and they had perfect grill marks and were cooked thru and still juicy.

Assembly instructions were idiot proof. The meat tasted incredibly good. I will never go back to charcoal grilling again.. Much easier to cook and prepare the fire.. and it tastes great. (Unless you are a charcoal pro, to cook with this one is much safer... you have a steady heat... no worries about the fire being too hot or too cold..) It is darn pricey and I am sure everybody is making good money out of it. (factory and Amazon :) ) but I rather pay more and use a decade, than having to change every two - three years.. WEBER is a great quality brand..If you are hesitating between 310, 320 and 330.. The side burner is something nice but not a must have.. But the searing station is a must if you want to make good steaks. It also helps to heat the grill faster.. Mine hit 500 F in 5 minutes... Regarding the color options...

My Weber Q 200 never got that hot, but I need to wear gloves with this one. Burning off after the hood temp got to almost 700 deg.Update to first impressions, got the 1/2' hose hooked up with a 12' extension, probably not recommended, required 1/2' gas flare to 1/2' npt adapter and a 1/2' nipple from Home Depot. I was very bad and skipped the bubble test until after firing up the grill the first time, just checked for hissing and odor before firing up the grill. Woh! 500 deg in five minutes! topped out at almost 600 deg, thank you Weber, thank you PG&E, no more propane tanks! :)Attached the rotiserie this evening and roasted a chicken, medium low on the two outer burners mantained 350 deg pretty well, can't wait to sear some steaks and burgers!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is my first Genesis and a preliminary review after assembly which took some work. While most of the surfaces and doors are stainless, the sides and cabinet are grey enamel. I haven't fired it up yet, but the BTU rating on the left side of the grill is over 100 BTU/sqin due to the extra burner while the right side is about 75. The right side has a extra flavorizer bar with no burner which seems odd. I think they should just add another sear burner on the right side. Overall the grill looks great and is bigger than I had imagined, the knobs are very big. I think I would skip the side burner as it seems cheap compared to the rest of the grill, and the quick connect on the side burner was difficult to connect. Note that this grill takes a 1/2' hose due to the higher BTU rating."

Overall there are quite a few choices when picking a weber grill. 1st things 1st, if you are debating between another grill and a weber genesis - stop. Don't spend your hard earned money on the cheap grills that lack quality but offer extra features. I fell for that too, bought a $700 Perfect flame grill from Lowes two years later it burned up, and the company wouldn't do a thing about it. Weber grills typically last 10-20 years, mind you after 5 years you may need to get some parts, but nothing last forever, not even SS burners. NOW for the details. There is the E-310, E-320 and E-330 models, all come in stainless like mine, but to be honest I wouldn't have paid the extra for it if they had a black one in stock. Now for features. If you don't need a side burner - get the 310. I need the side burner for bacon in the morning, because I hate smelling bacon all day in my house. Now the E-320 and E-330, all you really get with the 330 is a sear burner(just an extra burner) Is it worth the 50 bucks? That is in the eye of the beholder. It does heat up faster and is nice for searing, besides your already spending 750 whats an extra 50(mine was 950 for the stainless, definately not worth the extra 150 especially since the enamel doesn't scratch easy - go ahead and take out your keys and try it on a floor model, very impressive). Overall, I am very satisfied with the grill. Constuction is way better than any other grill I have seen for the price(I built mine myself and it went together well). Only thing I would change is the plastic washers on the cart, which I will replace tomorrow(plasi-dip some metal washers). Grill preheats in less than 5 mins at 50 deg F, that was to 550. Basically, it looks nice, cooks well, and will last a long time!!!"

It heats rapidly and gives you great control - between the powerful gas jets and opening the top I can gain or lose 200 degrees in half a minute easy.  I  love the sear station burner which makes it easier to maintain a hot side and a 'cold' side.  I also love the side burner - perfect for cooking a pot of corn or pasta or whatever to go along with the meat.In a perfect world I would like the sides to be stainless steel (or at least offer it as an extra cost option)...but that is really the only complaint I can think of.Lastly, CAVA does the delivery and I found them to be useless and rude.  Amazon promised me a date and I waited all day for them.  At the end of the day I contacted them and got a response that said basically,  &#34;Yeah...we were going to call you.  The only day we can deliver it is next Tuesday...and you have to be there that day.&#34;  When I said I couldn't be there that day (but Monday or Wednesday would be OK) she threatened me with 'then we'll have to transfer it to another delivery company and you might not get it for a week or two'.  I had to be quite firm and so got the 'I'll have to talk to the driver and my supervisor' answer...and it was delivered on Wednesday.Anyway...the point of my CAVA rant is that you should definitely order this grill, but keep in mind that CAVA thinks whatever Amazon sends you about delivery dates/times is fiction.  And that you may need to be firm with them should they mess up."

I was going back and forth as to whether I wanted an infrared grill because it supposedly cooks quicker but ultimately decided against it because there is supposedly more maintenance issues with them.  I have not been disappointed with the Weber.  It heats up very quickly, it will be 600 degrees in six minutes.  And my steaks are done to perfection in 5 minutes.  You will get a better steak cooking it on this grill than you ever will going out to eat at a restaurant for a fraction of the cost and grilling is fun!  As for the sear station, there is no problems with it either, it gets plenty hot to caramelize your meat.  The side burner works like it is supposed to.  It is nice to have to cook the bacon with while the burgers are cooking.  I know you can cook it just as easy in the house but then your house smells like a bacon pit afterwards, so the side burner is a nice extra.I love the &#34;flavorizer&#34; bars this grill has as well.  I did not understand what those were until I got the grill.  They are triangular bars that the grease and all the other good stuff drips on, when it hits the bar, it smokes so that your meat gets that nice smoked flavor.All and all it is a very nice grill and I see no reason why this grill shouldn't last me at least 10 years.  I know it is a lot of money but then again what isn't if it is built well?If I have any troubles later on with the grill I will update this post but I'm sure I won't have to!"

From the gas lines to the casters to the weight of the cook box and lid, immediately you can tell this is a grill with substantially greater quality than any other grill in the price range. The sear station works great, helping the grill to heat up to 500F within about 7 minutes!  My first steak had perfect sear marks after only a couple minutes.  A few flips over lowered heat created a great tasting and perfectly cooked steak.  You can tell immediately that the heat distribution is very even over the eitire cooking surface, which is hard to find in most grills of any price range.  I don't expect to use the side burner nearly as much as the grill but it is nice to have the option in case I want to cook fish or something else that I don't want my whole house to smell like!  The flame coming from the side burner looks very uniform and I haven't used it yet but I could only assume it cooks very evenly as well (not that it really makes a big difference with a circular burner under a pan).The installation took roughly 3 hrs so be prepared to meticulously follow instructions and dedicate a good chunk of time to put it together.  The results are well worth the work however.  I would definitely recommend using a small socket wrench rather than the supplied wrench, which is fairly worthless in my opinion.  Some of the sheet metal pieces seemed flimsy at first but when all locked together, they created a very sturdy foundation for the grill.  Do be careful when putting the components together as there were a couple sharp edges on some of the pieces of metal, including the flavorizer bars.This is a great grill which you will realize as soon as you get it put together.  If you have the money to purchase a great grill that you won't have to replace for 10-15+ years then buy this grill.  You will not be disappointed.  If you don't have the money for it, just buy a decent $300 grill and keep it for a few years.  Since I grill 3-4 times a week, this grill is well worth the money in my opinion."

On the day scheduled for delivery the carrier called to give us a delivery time within 1 hour.  Excellent work ABF (the carrier).  Finely, the product.  Amazon said the package weighs 190 lbs. and I believe it.  The carton was too heavy to move so we opened it and moved the pieces one by one to the assembly area.

So I guess I can say that I am a heavy grill user.I did a lot off research before buying this grill.  My two burner grill that I have used for the past 13 years finally had more holes in the bottom than what I could handle.  I wanted to replace the grill with the same make but to my dismay I found out that the grill is now manufactured in China and that it is manufactured with inferior steel.So my quest started to find a replacement for my trusty but tired old grill.I have always heard that Weber is the best in grills but I was not convinced.  I research a lot, comparing the Webber to just about every other brand on the market and the Webber always came out on top.  After I decided on the Webber I priced shop a lot and found that the price for the Webber is basically the same all round.  I ordered the grill from Amazon and it arrived a few days later.  The grill is heavy.  I opened the box and carried the parts to the deck where I assembled it.  I opened all the boxes and laid the parts out on the deck before I started the assembly.  That made the task easier for me.I took me about 3 hours to assemble the grill on my own.  I took my time and made sure that I followed the instructions to the letter.  The parts all fitted without any problems.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that you can save time by using a proper wrench instead of the wrench that comes with the grill.  I also had to use a little bit of force to make some of the holes fit when installing the side burner.  It was a minor inconvenience and not real issue.After I assembled the grill I hooked the gas tank up and it fired up immediately.  I could tell that this grill is in a different class than my previous grill which was pretty good.  It heated up very quickly.I have already grilled ribs, chops, steaks and salmon on it.  All of the food was very tasty.  This grill is fantastic it is easy to control the temperature and the sear burner gives you all the power that you need.  The side burner is very potent to. I have used it to make breakfast and stir-fry in a wok and it has all the heat that I would want.I am very glad that I took the time to research and made a decision on this grill.  It looks good it grills well and it is a quality tool for a backyard griller.

The next day she interegated the shippers call center and found out that the truck had broken down. She was not a happy camper on Tuesday either. Wednesday she stayed home again and recieved the grill. What's the economic value/cost of a two days of PO'd wife, answer=a lot.Moral of this story, Free delivery means 0$, but there can be substantial opportunity cost!"

The grill will be delivered by truck freight on a pallet, so if you are unable to have the pallet placed where you will be assembling the grill, you will be opening the box and moving the grill piece-by-piece to your assembly location.  Not a big deal but certainly not as convenient as having the box delivered to the assembly location.Nothing difficult about assembly.Due to the reflectivity of new materials, the grill will run hot until a grease film has coated the inside of the lid.  I have used the grill three times with flawless results.I also purchased the Weber 7549 premium cover, which fits the grill with the island cabinetry.

Amazon Customer Comments identified this shortcoming so I wasn't surprised to find it. In my opinion the Weber Marketing photos are intentionally deceptive, the only photo of the side of the grill is taken at an angle using a dark gray background. Conveniently, the 'so called' customer photos on the Amazon site do not provide any side photos. I believe this speaks to the Weber Marketing team's efforts to obscure the truth and mislead customers. That said, the function and form of the design and the quality of the workmanship are outstanding. All of the parts/assemblies fit together easily. I inventoried and organized the parts then took my time assembling my new grill and this Granpa finished in 3 hours. It was a labor of love.

I also have a smoker that I use often.  I read about the Weber and believed it to be a solid make.  So here is the skinny on it, from my perspective.  It is the dirtiest cooking BBQ I've owned.  Oil runs down the legs of the grill onto stain my deck.  Doesn't matter if it is cleaned or full of grease.  It doesn't cook great, not even kinda great.  It drinks propane like a desert thirsty nomad in an Oasis.  It does does not heat evenly and flares quite a lot.  It does have a nice drainage system but it fills quickly.  The Weber S-330 is Chinese quality workmanship.Consumers be AWARE that this grill is 90% 400 series stainless.  Weber freely uses the term stainless as do most Chinese quality BBQ builders.  300 series stainless is the standard in premium stainless for grills.  200 series is harder than 300 series but is more prone to corrosion.  400 series is more corrosive than either 300 or 200.  The stainless on my S-330 is of poor quality and unfortunately I fell for the hype of deceitful advertising and no doubt much lobbying.  This is not a premium product.

We are also blessed with heat.  From May to September it is hot.  Winter is our only respite.  So when it was time to replace my aging Weber, I naturally looked for an old friend, but one with more capability.  I found the S-330 natural gas Weber to fill the bill.  Assembly was a little of a chore, but I conned my younger son to help me and paid him off with the old Weber.  After learning the grill, I decided to expand my repertoire.  It was hot, really hot and my wife was making lasagna.  I volunteered to cook it on the grill.  Preheat to 500 degrees, cut off the center valve, adjust the two outside valves to the desired temperature, and bake away.Perfect.  I then tried the same procedure with oven fried chicken, coated with bread crumbs. I also have used this procedure for oven fried french fries. With the FF, Microwave sliced potatoes in bowl covered with plastic wrap.  Dry off potatoes really well then coat in mixture of one part each of cornstarch and olive oil (about 2T each).  Place on oiled cookie sheet in single layer.  Cook on grill (about 450-500) turning when brown on bottom.  Your imagination is your only limitation.  You have found a new use for the Weber.

Shipping was a nightmare due to the freight company that Amazon used to get it here. After three different delivery dates, and my staying home from work for each, it finally arrived here - at 10:30 PM!! Yes, not a typo. A poor, over-worked freight employee was delivering items late at night (from Boston) to my area of NH.OK, so I open the box to see what assembly it requires, and the instructions are minimal! Yes, it's a 'guy-thing' that we've all learned to work through, but assemby did take me more than 6 hours. Some small parts were missing but all of the most critical parts were there.So, what about the assembled product, you ask? The good and bad.The Good:It's sturdyIt seems durableThe electric 'start button' for the burners works like a charmThe most critical EXTERNAL parts that are most-prone to corrosion are stainless steelThe Bad:It took way too long to assembleMost of the grill is NOT made of stainless steelThe entire chasis is made of sheet metal that I suspect will rust in the foreseeable futureThe starter for the side burner doesn't work - I've had to light it manuallyIt does take quite a while to get hot, but with the lid down you do speed that upThe 'sear' feature leaves me underwhelmedI have NOT contacted Weber customer service and have no idea how they'd respond to my request for small missing parts. Fortunately, the bolts I'm missing are easing enough to buy at a hardware store.This review is not likely to please many people, but it honestly encapsulates the totality of my experience thus far. I've owned several other BBQ grills and this is hands-down the best one I've owned. HOWEVER, this grill cost me several times what I've paid for grills in the past! So, that must also be taken into consideration. Would I recommend this grill to others? Yes, IF you can buy it for substantially less than the price that I bought it for here. To me, this is a $500 grill. I've seen $500 grills made to similar levels of quality to this one - at Home Depot, BJs, etc.I hope my insights assist some of you in spending your money wisely. That's the great thing about using Amazon customer reviews.-------------------------------------------------UPDATE (09-27-2012)I thought I'd update my review of this product after using it a few times. The insights I've gained are well-worth sharing.I have used this grill just 5 times since buying and assembling it. That's significant because of what I just experienced when using it last night, for its 5th use. After the grill had been fired-up for about 15 minutes and I had placed several very lean steaks on the grill, I happened to be just a few feet away when I noticed what appeared to be flames visible between the hood and the frame. Fearing the worst, I quickly opened the hood and discovered that there was in fact a fire in the basin of the unit - below the grates and below the jets that flames are supposed to originate from. After quickly pulling the steaks from the grill and then turning off the propane, I noticed that the fire continued to burn for another 7 minutes. After the fire went out and everything cooled-down I went to work exploring what had happened. It turns out this design needs a good cleaning after each use - and not the usual level of cleaning. I had to remove all of the hardware from the grill's basin to access the very bottom of it - where grease and burnt residue collects. The problem seems to stem from the fact that drippings and burnt residue don't drain into the drip-pan beneath the grill's basin. Most of the drippings and residue just sits there since the basin is only slightly sloped toward the opening in the basin that feeds the drip pan. So, after just five uses, I had an accumulation of sludge that you can't even see unless you remove all of the hardware from beneath the grates. Clean-up was .... as messy as you might expect, and it took about 30 minutes to thoroughly scrape the greasy, burnt residue from the basin and the rims of the basin, then clean all of the hardware that resides in the grill's basin. A putty-knife comes in handy getting everything loose and removed.Could the above issue be a safety problem? I'm guessing it could be, if the accumulation of grease and residue is allowed to persist AND if you tend to walk away from your grill when cooking. I'd also worry about this problem occurring if your grill is too close to anything else that is flammable. I hope this feedback assist someone else in avoiding a similar problem."

It heats up (and HOT) quickly. It is easy to control the heat once you put your food on the grill. The sear station works really well - my steaks always look picture perfect. I'm sure the stainless steel 'flavorizer' bars and the stainless steel grates will last a long time.My only complaint, and it's my fussiness as much as anything, is that the stainless exterior is hard to keep clean. It cleans up well with a good cleaner (I use Bar Keepers Friend) but it takes 15-20 minutes to clean. If I had it to do over again, I would buy this same grill, but would get the enamel exterior (I think only available at Ace).Still, I bought this grill to cook on, not to look at, and it cooks to perfection.I should also mention that Amazon's shipping was excellent. I live in a somewhat rural area and it took an extra few days for delivery because the delivery company only comes to my area once a week. Thus the grill sat in their receiving area for almost a week, but that's not Amazon's problem.My wife and I put the shipping box to good use, and had lots of fun, making a playhouse for our grandson.

I've owned this grill for over an year, I cook on it year round, usually 2-4 days a week, everything from Chicken, Steak, Ribs, Brisket, Fish, veggies, etc IF you can grill it, I COOK IT. The temperature control is amazing, with a single burner on low you can go as low as ~230, which is enough to get a wood box smoking, and long smoke some BBQ!!! For steaks and chicken that need searing even on ALL MEDIUM (including sear station ) it will go up to 600 degrees. On all high, you will prob max the grill out. The first day I cooked on it, it said put all burners on high (I don't thing they assume you have the sear station). The grill maxed the gauge and was climbing with the grates GLOWING. This thing gets MELTING HOT if you want it to. The stainless grates clean up perfectly and doesn't even attempt to rust at all. They are super high quality unlike the E series. I'll be honest . . . I left this grill uncovered as I used for it a full year. The stainless is so high quality the other day I wiped it down with the hose and some dish soap. It's now shining like the day I pulled it out of the box.  It's AMAZING quality stainless. It holds in the heat perfect. The only thing I recommend is get the Weber tilt light for the handle. Outside of that its the perfect grill. My friends are jealous as their bigger grills can't come close to putting beautiful SEAR MARKS (~600-650 degrees) or I hear them complain cold spots on the grill. This thing is perfectly EQUALLY spaced; everything cooks even! The flavor bars WORK, they inject so much flavor back into the food. I couldn't be happier. I still have yet to max out the surface area of the grill. It's easy to cook for 4-6 people at once and still have 1/3 the grill left. If your questioning to buy it, STOP. . JUST BUY IT. IS it expensive? SURE. Will it last season after season, YES no doubt. Your neighbors may get those bigger kitchen style grills, but this does 10x's the job and will last year after year while looking gorgeous. I have no doubt this will be a grill for the next 15 years, thats hard to say about anything these days!!"

Made in USA was a must this time around, no options.  I also wanted multiple burners, stainless grates and internals.  I considered the Summit 420 but could not justify the cost and features, the S-330 fit my needs perfectly.  I have used this grill more than a dozen times since purchasing and have zero complaints.  It grills all food with precision from big fat burgers to the softest flaky fish.Comments:Amazon had ABF Freight deliver to my house.  The delivery was painless and exactly on time.  The driver was friendly and put the grill right into my garage.Assembly took 90 minutes from time I cut the straps off the box till I was ready to fire it up. Cut the box around the bottom and lift off.  Split and save the box and use it as an assembly mat to protect all the pieces. Use a real screwdriver and 11mm socket to speed things up.  Every hole and part aligned perfectly. There were no missing or spare parts.  Instructions were clear enough for anyone used to DYI projects.Before firing up the grill, clean all the internal parts with soap and water especially the stainless cooking grates.  Fire up and let it run at high temp for 20 minutes or so to burn-in.  First time you cook on the grates coat them with canola or similar vegetable oil to help season them. After each use clean the grill using Webers T shaped stainless grill brush #6424, this brush works wonders with little effort."

I just about passed out when I looked up the price ($5K) for that grill on Amazon.  It works well, but I decided that I needed another grill on my OTHER deck, as well.So I ended up with the Weber for the upper deck.  Everything about it is good quality.  The pieces fit together perfectly (except for the 'quick-connect' line to the side burner, which took quite a bit of effort), and the instructions are pure genius.  They are nearly all pictorial, and completely unambiguous with regards to which bolt or washer to use.  It took me less than 2 hours to set up the entire thing from scratch on my own.  The last grill I put together, a Kenmore, took me the bulk of a weekend to accomplish.The flames are perfect, and the heat seems even.  It gets hot quickly, and I did not experience any flare-ups grilling three T-bones (and I had brushed them with oil, which tends to make flare-ups more likely).  I did not use the side burner but it appears to be well-sized to handle most any pan that you might put on it, and it puts out a nice flame.I like the expansive storage space underneath, as well as slots on both the right and the left for hanging barbeque utensils.Overall, this is a solid grill that I feel is in many ways superior to the $5K grill that came with my house, and at less than 20% of the price."

The instructions for putting it together were excellent.  It took me about 3 hours, taking my time.  What struck me is just how precise everything lined up and fit.  I like the canister weighing mechanism.  The fit and finish are superb.  The materials are high quality with no rough edges.The first item I grilled was a cattleman's cut.  It cooked up very nice and a little faster than I expected.  I found the sear station did what was advertised.  The temperature control is precise.

The added sear station marks your steaks perfectly. The slide out tray is excellent for cleaning. As this is my 3rd weber gas grill, you can expect at least 5 good years out of this grill. The stainless steel is easy to clean.  If you do not take the time to clean the grill you will get flare ups.  This grill gets to 700 degrees rather quickly. I use this when I am cleaning the grill before cooking. You can spend less but you will not get the quality. Webers customer service is great and the warranty on their grills are awesome. It only comes down to if you want to take the effort to rebuild old grill. My last weber had the body warp after about 1500 uses. Weber offered to send new part but I opted to buy a new grill instead of rebuilding. Many greats meals will be made by this grill."

Overall, I found it very frustrating trying to look at pictures to discern if I am using the correct screw, nut or bolt.  Lastly, all of my previous Weber Grills came with incredibly large and excellent cookbooks; however, Weber must have really skimped in this area this year as Weber only include a pamphlet sized cookbook that pales in comparison to their previous publications."

Amazon was our choice for free shipping and could arrive sooner than other websites. Assembly took close to two hours, and we were initially concerned because putting a different brand grill together for my sister took much longer for my husband and son-in-law and they thought those instructions confusing.

It did have a separate sear burner outside the main box, but when cooking six big steaks, moving them one at time to that burner was just impractical.Both my father-in-law and brother-in-law have older Webers that are still in excellent condition, but I didn't like the burners running left to right (as opposed to front to back), which is what sold me on the Sam's Club grill in the first place (besides the lower price...Note:  Buyer Beware...you get what you pay for!).The Weber Genesis S-330 has been 'remodeled' and now has a cure to both my concerns; it has a sear burner inside the main box, and the burners all run front to back.After doing a lot of research on the internet trying to find THE perfect grill within my budget...OK, the wife's budget for me) I decided on this one and then began searching for the best place to buy it.  After several weeks of checking ads and asking questions at stores (Lowes, Home Depot, etc.) I soon discovered I was probably not going to find this grill on sale any time soon.  In fact, I also found that L and H did not even stock the all stainless model...I was totally willing to pay ~$150 more for all SS vs an enamel colored one...and the wife even agreed!)So, after giving up on searching for sales I then purchased it on Amazon Prime where I didn't have to pay Ca. sales tax.  That was almost like getting it on sale!The 190 lb. box arrived as scheduled and un-damaged, and I then proceeded to carry all the individual parts through the house and onto the back deck where assembly soon began.  I have to admit that assembly appeared daunting at first (between all the parts spread all over the deck and the large sheet of step by step assembly instructions), but after opening the first beer, getting my tools, and finding parts for step #1, it all fell into place very smoothly.  During the assembly process I marveled several times at the quality of the parts, first from the construction aspect, and then from the fit...not ONCE was any hole, bolt, screw or slot mis-aligned!Since we use propane for heating and cooking in the house, I have a propane line running to the deck for the grill (and space heater).  So I made one modification in assembly and instead of mounting the gas line to the inside of the side wall of the grill for attachment to a small propane tank, I mounted it on the outside for attaching the long gas line I use to move it around the deck as needed.  (And I love that all four wheels rotate 360 degrees instead of being like my old grill where one set of wheels are fixed...like a car.  This really helps moving the unit around tables, chairs, etc.)After leak checking and running all the burners full blast for a while to burn off the 'factory smell' I then set about grilling my first steak...and I was NOT disappointed!!!  It worked PERFECTLY (in fact, can you say blast furnace!?!)  And the side burner was great for steaming some vegetables and not adding that extra heat to house.My wife is now sick of me every now and then, out of the blue, saying, 'Have I told you how much I love my new grill?'Thanks Amazon Prime and thanks Weber!"

This 330 is the next generation in the Genesis line evolution. I highly recommend this 2011+ model. A few differences from the older ones...1) Easier to assemble. Many of the burner and manifold components are now completed in sub assemblies.2) There is a visual instruction sheet that takes you through all of the construction steps. You still need tools - socket wrenches and wrenches - but it was easier to assemble the second time around.3) The burner controls are on the front of the unit - not on the sides. This gives you more work table room on both the left and right hand sides of the grill.4) The new searing feature is FANTASTIC.This is NOT an all stainless steel constructed unit. There are painted alumminum sides. Turns out this was not an issue with our old 330. It has stood the test of 4 years of use and still looks great. Definately invest in the Weber grill cover specifically for the 330. This keeps it looking great for years from weather, birds, etc.Amazon service and delivery were excellent as usual. The delivery service called 30 minutes before delivery on the date we selected and they were on time and took the unit into our garage. The box is large and heavy and I would suggest having it delivered to the location where you intend to build or keep the grill.The new version of the 330 gets a 5 stars out of 5 this time.

I have owned a lot of grills in my 80 years and I have to say this is the best by far.After doing considerable research, I decided on this Weber Genisess S-330 I have only had it for a month, so I cant attest to its longevity, but from what I see it is well engineered and constructed and at my age I am sure it will be my last grill.  So far I have cooked, hamburger, steaks, chicken, pork ternderloin and a standing Rib Roast, all to perfection.  I cook a lot on a grill and use it several times a week.  There are many features I like about this grill, it heats up fast (goes to nearly 700 degres in 10 minutes).  I love the sear station burner for searing and fast heat-up.  The temperature is easy to control, the grates and other parts are easy to clean.  I have a laundry sink in my screened in back porch where the grill is and I just put the grill grates and other removale itmen in hot soapy water in the sink and clean with a grill brush.  The stainless steel looks great and wipes clean on all exterior parts.  Other than the way it cooks and cleans, I especially like the four casters it is mounted on. I can push it around with one hand and put it where I want to grill and when I am done and it has cooled, I just push it up against the wall, out of the way.  I also bought the weber grill cover which is high quality and I keep it covered, even though it is in a closed in porch.  I have had other high-end grills, but they just dont come up to the quality of this grill.  I also like the straight-line burnes that are coved by the flavorize bars that keep them fom stopping up.  I bought my grill from a local grill and fireplace store and they delivered it put together and gave me a dmo, all for $940.00 and threw in the fifty dollar cover since I declined the tank filled with gas that they offered,( I have plenty of tanks) I dont know where else I could have gotten a better deal or better grill for the money.  They have grills that sell for up to $10,000.00, but this grill will do all I will ever want it to do.  If you are loking a top quality grill at a very reasonable price, dont look any further, this is the one to buy, you wont regret it.Rex In NC"

The delivery was scheduled for the following week and was received on time and in good order.  I was surprised to see a small (passenger-type) van pull up and two men unload this 190 lb. box.  One person wheeled it to my garage and deposited the large box.  I waited until help was available to assist in removing the grill and put it together.  The primary issue with this order was that the grill was delivered without any instructions.  There are 27 steps involved in assembling this grill and I wouldn't recommend most people attempting their first install on this item without instructions.  Thankfully,  I found someone on YouTube who recorded the step by step procedures for assembling a similar model.  From unboxing, sorting the items in order of install and the actual assembly.  His effort saved me a lot of frustration caused by the manufacturers failure to include instructions.  Even so it took about 2 hours to install,  though it could probably be done a little faster the second time around.  An impromptu grilling party ensued and all were pleased with the brats and hot dogs which this grill prepared.  I also opted to get the Weber grill cover for this model family (which i definitely recommend obtaining a cover) and a set of stainless steel grilling tools.  I'd be grilling out right now instead of writing this review if it weren't pouring down rain. Pleased with the purchase after getting it installed, and thankful to a kind person on YouTube."

Seems like the units you pick up at the big box stores for $500 just aren't made to last. The last two grills I had I picked up at Sam's club. They sure looked impressive with their stainless steel panels and 6 burners but the problems were countless wheels that broke off, the main tub rusted out the bottom on one. Other issues with the Sam's unit were that IF parts were available the cost of the parts just made the unit not worth fixing.So I put off buying a Weber for years always said they were too expensive and if your just looking at them sitting next to a Char broil that costs half as much a novice might not see the difference, but here's what impressed me.1. HUGE casters, These things are 4' round and are not the cheap plastic ones you find on other grills they have like a neoprene outer part that makes them roll nicely. PLUS all 4 casters spin. (front ones lock)2. The tub not cheap thin steel CAST ALUMINUM very nice!3. Main frame. I was impressed by how thick the steel was much higher quality than my previous Members Mark (Sam's) units4. Double wall construction. The top and doors all have outer and inner skin. That ensures that your top won't discolor as much with the heat.5. The grates. What can i say the stainless steel grates are GREAT! I had a Char Broil that I bought from Lowes that looked like it had tube grates but in fact they were U shaped stainless steel pcs. that were held together in a frame. they worked ok untill I dropped one cleaning it and it fell apart into 40 pcs. It took me over an hour to get that grate back together. That will NEVER be an issue here stainless steel bars all welded together. I'm sure you could just pop them in the dishwasher to keep them clean.6. The grease tray. If you haven't seen whats under the cooking area you should. First off the main tray is porcelain coated so grease won't stick to it. The grease drips from thee into this little tub that's easily removable from the front.  And even better yet Weber throws in 2 aluminum trays that are disposable. They look like the inexpensive aluminum baking trays you get at grocery stores.  What could be better if you don't want to remove and clean the metal tray just buy the cheap aluminum inserts and throw them away when they are full.7. Hood Hinges. On 2 of my previous grills the hood would no longer stay upright the cheap metal that was supposed to stop the lid from falling backwards just bent. That will not be a problem here, cast aluminum hinge assemblies very thick, very nice.8. The nuts and bolts. I was also impressed by the hardware it was color coded (grey or black) and Weber uses plastic washers in between metal parts. This shows an attention to detail that other manufacturers just are not willing to spend money on.Now the things I don't like.1. Chrome trim. In my experience Chrome trim + Chicago weather just don't do well together long term. There is chrome trim on the top sides of the lid, the doors have chrome trim around them as well and of course the handles are chrome.2. Fit & finish the chrome trim around the front doors has VERY sharp edges. (This is an excellent spot for rust to start in as well) Some of the exposed edges of the cast tub have some sharp edges to them.3. Assembly. Wasn't terrible but I think they should have shipped it in a larger box and had the whole center (stand, tub and lid) pee-assembled. Some of the screws seems a bit out of alignment but nothing an extra helper couldn't help force into place.Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase I paid $829 for mine from rainbow appliance with free shipping I think it was a great deal.I do have some thoughts about the one or two people who did not rate this very well. First off this was the first owners manual I read. And to tell you the truth I was shocked at some of the things they tell you to do. For instance preheat the grill for 15 minutes. Personally I don't think i ever gave my grill more than 5 minutes before slapping down a chunk of beef. I don't think the 'average' grill owner knows how to properly grill. Heck I've had 4 grills and I now know that I personally was 'clueless' to the art of grilling.________________update___________________________I took 2 stars off because weber tech support pot me through 2 months of hell with this.At 4 months old the grill started giving me trouble getting it started. I called their 800 number and they told me to turn the gas on wait 2 minutes and then start it. And that worked a few times but every week it got harder and harder to start and every week they would have me do something else.Then they started with the 'your turning the gas on too fast' and some other BS like I don't know how to start a grill (after all its only my 4th propane grill)well after 2 months and about 6 calls they finally decided to send me a new regulator and that fixed the problem. My complaint is why didn't they offer the regulator after the second or third call. 2 months of hell spending 5-10 minutes each time I wanted to start this.If I had known that a regulator would have fixed the problem I would have PAID for one. and for their customer service to tell you that you are turning the gas on too fast is just ridiculous."

Still, I could not resist aiming for the bargain brands.  That I had to keep buying new grills should have been a deterrent.  It wasn't.I've only had this Genesis S-330 for a couple of weeks, so I can't speak to durability.  But I can definitely touch on ease of assembly (very, even with a glass of wine, though two pairs of hands made the job go much more quickly) and joy of use.  Assembly took just about two hours.  It would have been closer to three if I'd been soloing as some of the parts are a little heavy.Operationally speaking, it did take a minute to figure out that, unlike many cheaper grills, when you fire up this model, each burner must be lit separately.  Most of the units I've owned ignited the right-hand burner electronically, then the other burners ignited from that lit burner as the gas was turned on for each.  The Weber burners each light from the electronic igniter.  A little off-putting at first  I was sure the grill was broken), this turned out to be a nice touch.  No more surprise ignitions!Cooking on this unit is a joy.  The searing station, as mentioned in another review, is a very handy tool for getting that nice, crusty exterior, and it serves well to preheat the grill more quickly.  Turn it on first and turn it off when you're ready to cook things you won't be searing.  The grilling surface is lovely.  The stainless racks, while not coated to be stick-free, still manage to avoid winding up with half of dinner glued to them.  This may change with time and use, but for now it's a plus.  The knobs that adjust the burner flames are large, well-marked, and smooth-turning, which makes fine tuning possible.If there's any down side to this grill, it would have to be the weight of the hood.  That's hardly a bad thing as it keeps the temperature inside very even, but it's always necessary for a small person like me for whom it is a reach to make sure the hood is completely raised before trying to do anything with the food on the racks.  That thing slams down with authority if you try to make a quick dash at turning something.  I would appreciate a partially-opened stopping place so that the heat doesn't escape quite so effectively while I'm flipping something fragile.I would recommend this grill to anyone who truly enjoys outdoor cooking.  I am a year-round griller as there's nothing better in my book than a char-broiled anything, animal or vegetable, and I am not afraid to slog out in the rain and snow to achieve that.  If you're frustrated with grills that don't really do the job and rot out before you're ready to replace them, you're a candidate for an upgrade.  Go Weber or go home!"

I typically have 1-2 more grilling days before I need a new bottle even though the gauge says empty.  Temperature control is great.  The searing station is kind of unnecessary.  I have found the regular burners do a sufficient job.  The side burner will get the job done.  I don't like the price which is why I gave it a 4 out of 5.  If it was 150-200 dollars cheaper it would be 5 of 5."

My second grill was a Broilmaster, crazy expensive, and it was junk. We literally gave it away. It broke down from the start and their customer service was apalling. What a difference with WEBER! I contacted them to find out about local installers and although I ended up not using one, Weber was very responsive and the installer who called me told to just give it a shot and try putting it together myself, that it was simple (and I would be saving myself the installation fee, yippe!).Amazon's delivery service was superb, on time, item delivered without ANY damage, curteous service.Weber's packaging SUPER. Just the right size.Putting it together was a lot of work (time involved) but not complicated. We have not stopped using it since we put it together. It cooks like a dream, it has no cold spots and it heats very even. Temperature control is accurate and overall I couldn't be happier with the purchase.I plan to review it again in about a year to see how it holds up.May 2012 Follow UpStill in love with my grill. Best purchase for my patio...it cooks like a dream, no hot/cold sports and now that I've used it for almost a year I can say it Weber ROCKS grills...why would anyone but anything else? All my friends compliment my grilling, but it's not me, it's the equipment...and it is holding up pretty well. I do cover it up right after it cools off but still...it stays outside uncovered from the elements. No rust sports or streaks, and it looks like new when I use the SS cleaner. I highly recommend this grill."

Easy to Assemble--Gas Lines are Preassembled","I bought this stainless steel grill as we have gone through a number of grills that last 2-3 years before everything is rusted out.  Also, the less expensive grills never seem to heat evenly after a while.I was not looking forward to assembling this unit as other feedback indicated that it had a lot of parts.  Also, I was not too keen on assembling gas lines given the potential for fires and such, but in the end I was confident that I could put it together and I could not find this unit at Home Depot, Lowes, or other outlets (which sold grills that would rust away).In the end, ALL OF THE GAS LINES WERE PRE-ASSEMBLED IN THIS GRILL.  The only assembly step that involved a gas line that I had to perform was to mate a quick connect when attaching the side burner--kudos to Weber on a great assembly experience!  All that needed to be assembled was the structural components that make up the cabinet and such.  The directions were very clear and assembly was very easy.  Assembly only took me about 1 1/2 hours.The grill cooks very nice and even.  Also, the sear burners work great--the meat is much juicier when you sear it before cooking it on lower heat.This was an excellent experience.  If you have at least moderate technical skills, I would not hesitate to purchase this grill.  Don't worry about having to assemble gas lines for this grill--the only things you assemble are low risk components.  I highly recommend purchasing this grill."

The new burner alignment and grill design create a much more even cooking surface. I also like the position of the knobs on the front panel, which allows the grill to take up a smaller footprint without losing any space on the side trays. The side burner is located under a cover that is flush with the rest of the side tray, so when it is not in use it is very unobtrusive. Finally, it's very nice to have the lower enclosure with the stainless steel doors. This not only makes the grill much more attractive, it also keeps my labrador from getting into the drip pan below the grill. This grill is on the expensive side, but in my view, well worth the extra dollars."

When I went back out to use the grill I was surprised that every thing in all the cabinets were soaked through from the rain!  I had to get a towel to soak up all the rain in all the cabinets.  This is kind of a drag since I planned on keeping many outdoor items in the cabinets that I don't want to get constantly wet.  I just assumed the inside would stay dry but the way it's designed water gets in from all sides.So I guess the solution is to get the custom cover for this or keep it in a location that protects it from rain."

The first start up, it heated to 600 degrees in about 7 minutes and was ready to cook.  Our first meal was a USDA prime ribeye with some homemade spicy sausage.  I also sauteed some mushrooms to go with the steak on the side burner.  I utilized the sear burner for about about 4 minutes on each side of the steak and then cooked them for another 4 minutes on each side using direct heat.  Absolutely perfect steak.  I have a charcoal Weber I use routinely on the weekends however this is a must addition when needing to cook something in a small amount of time.  I would also say that I had two other gas grills in the past 8 years and they lasted about 4 years each until the inside became unbearable to use and had to replace parts, which turned into a pain.  I hope the reviews I read prior to purchasing this grill are correct and get at least 10 years out of it.  It is definitely the heaviest grill I remember having."

When you lean back in the swing your head rests against these openings and my daughter's head slipped right through.

I hung it under my deck with a big hook rated for a higher weight than the chair and a similar chain from the home improvement store. It took nothing to set up. It kind of squishes you up in the net/seat so I wouldn't really call it comfortable but something about it makes people want to get in it and stay there in spite of that. You might picture yourself sitting in it sipping a drink, that's rather awkward unless you hold the cold drink on your leg since your arms rotate in to your body like a cocoon. As an option to a traditional chair, it's a gimmick that someone will sit in.

During its first use pieces of the rope/string started to come untied and we had to retie them.  It has been been up for two days, hanging in a tree and used by our kids, and it is now pretty much unusable due to the untied strings and uneven gaps that form.

The price cannot be beat and as a stay at home mom--I compare prices and quality from dozens of sources including consumer reports (where I have a membership). That being stated, purchasing this product vs. some of the other types and brands from Amazon--I have to recommend this above all the others. Now let's reiterate price....This is a BARGAIN and coming from me in a one income household during the toughest economic climate since the great depression--that should say a lot! (Sorry about that slight political statement there I have a B.A. in Political Science and sometimes can't help myself:) If you want a little luxury in your backyard or for a camping trip--this one is affordable and worth the small expenditure. Lastly let's talk shipping--if you don't already have an Amazon Prime membership--get one. It may seem costly at first but think about it. The membership costs about $80 for a full year unlimited shipping on Prime eligible products (which is nearly everything) Each time you make a purchase on Amazon you spend a minimum of $3.99 for standard shipping. Assuming you never spend anymore than that for standard shipping (not likely) buy 20 things in a year and the prime membership has paid for itself. What's best is you always get free 2 day shipping. Oh, and please don't mistake the statement about the cost of standard shipping as a dig towards amazon--their regular rates are cheaper than most stores will give you. In the case of this hammock chair--other sites like Dick's and EMS sports, LL Bean wanted twice as much for the chair and the shipping charges went from $8-$12 for standard shipping (7-10 business days) --with the Amazon Prime, it was FREE!!and it got here in 2 days. One last thing is you can share an Amazon Prime membership with up to 5 family members. For us, My husband uses it with his account which is separate from mine, my cousin uses it also, but my mom prefers to just use my account and she gets the prime that way--but still the cool thing is my husband has his own account separate from mine and we share one prime membership. I feel I had to share this in the review of this item because the Amazon Prime savings for this one item was 1/8 of the cost of the membership fee and trust me--after purchasing my other hammocks, tent, and camping gear the week before last it paid for itself. There is no other way I could have bought $100 of camping and leisure equipment that valued over $300 and paid shipping for the cost of this membership. Quick last side note--if your in NY state there is a small place just outside Ellicotville called Rock City State Forest--it is free to camp there. Very few people know about it, but like I mentioned earlier we as a society in whole are struggling economically and need to save money any way we can, FREE  camping allows anyone like me with a big family to do so without sacrificing quality fun time with the family!  DON'T FORGET TO CHECK OUT THE AMAZON PRIME MEMBERSHIP DETAILS in case there are other perks I forgot to mention--I really don't know how my family would make ends meet and have fun things without Amazon right now without sacrificing me having to go back to work--and not being able to be home with the kids."

The cotton rope used for this chair is very soft and stretches and frays very easily.  The first chair broke after thirty minutes of swinging.  They were doing a little twisting, and the ropes that hang it up frayed and snapped.  I replaced the hanging rope, and now it is fine, but some of the other parts are starting to fray, as well.  A second safety issue is that the ropes pull apart quite easily, creating large gaps which the children fall through, and could very easily get their heads stuck in.  I created a full length seat cover to make it more safe.  They have LOVED using it, but I would not recommend this item at all due to the safety issues and poor quality."

I shopped around & read reviews for several makes from $20 to over $150. I took a chance on this chair for under $20, the reviews were good. We have had it up for 3 weeks and so far no problems. We leave it out in sun & rain. The cotton rope has not shrunk much after being rained on. The rope the chair is made from is heavy, the knots tight, & the frayed rope ends secured with thin plastic sleeves. The cross bar is 1-1/4' round hardwood & the 3 rings are 1/4' cross-section welded steel. For under $30, including shipping, if it lasts 2 years I'll be satisfied. As for comfort, the chair is wide & deep so if you are average size, you can cross your legs & lean back for comfort. Sitting in the chair with your legs hanging out, the front rope will pull into your legs just behind the knees and hurt a bit. This is just the nature of a rope chair vs a full size hammock which you can lay flat on. We'll get a seat cushion to ease the pulling when we sit legs out in the chair.So far, no complaints on this chair & the price can't be beat!"

I don't have any trees in my back yard so I just tied it up under my trampoline. I found this really helpful in allowing my girls to learn how to use it because if they fell it was only a couple inches and onto grass. I would highly recommend doing something like this if your getting this for your kids.You should know that it does not come with any ropes to tie it to anything so I just used some tiedown straps from my garage. It only has these open ended S hooks you can latch onto but I didn't think that was safe enough for my little girls so I bent them closed with some vice grips. I found some cheap carabiners at Home Depot for like $1 each to attach to both ends that seemed much safer. Even with the carabiners they still fold up nicely into their bags.The material is really soft and compared to those mesh ones it's AMAZING!I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the S hooks.

I bought this hammock for my husband because it was camo.  I, and most of my friends, own ENOs, but ENO didn't make a camo hammock.  Since it's ultralight, it seems a bit smaller than ENOs hammocks, which was an adjustment for my husband because he's 6'5" tall...but he still hops in there and hamms with the rest of us!  I think it's too small for him, but he doesn't seem to mind too much.

I am writing  this review to alert people looking for a hammock. First off, prepare yourself because this hammock does not come with anything to hang it with. You need separate lines to use because it only comes with S-hooks at either end. Secondly and mostly importantly if you do end up buying it you really GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. After two days of light use I (a 150 lbs male) fell straight through it when I went to lay down one morning while camping. So despite its claim it can take up to 250 lbs. I wouldn't trust it with anyone over 100 lbs. I wanted to right this review to let people know that this product is horrible, and if your looking for a long-lasting dependable hammock that has everything you are looking for right out of the package look elsewhere.

I bought one for myself some time ago and my stingy girlfriend has been hogging it every time we go out on a hike. So I went ahead and bought her one. It's a great hammock that crams nicely into a little pouch/pocket (attached to hammock). It's pretty lightweight which is super nice.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the first time I bought mine, it came with tree straps. The one I bought for the GF didn't come with any. Bought the same exact hammock from the same vendor. Lame sauce.

First off, the price. At only around $20 this hammock is well worth the money. If you're looking for one of these for backpacking, camping, or just lounging in the yard, this one will do the trick perfectly. The only thing any other product has to offer is that they include straps to connect the hammock to the tree. I simply went down to the local sporting good store and purchased 15 yards of nylon webbing for around $3, cut it in half, tied some basic knots on the ends and was able to easily hang my hammock up between trees distanced 10-15 feet apart. Perfect. Cheap. Great product.

This was my first hammock in attempting this new sleep system for camping and I was not disappointed.  I went out to buy an ENO Double Nest hammock, but still find myself using this one whenever I do multi-day trips because it is so much lighter and less bulky.  I can fit my suspension system, 2 8' pieces of webbing and my hammock and it is still smaller than the ENO itself.  This hammock has proved to be pretty durable.  For the price, this is the best hammock hands down.

packs small but bag is already ripping off the side after just a few uses,  it did not have anything to tie it up with and when lying down you get wrapped up rather tight.<br /><br />Overall I would say spend more and get something that might last more than a few shorts uses.  Although rated to 250 or 300 lb we heard the material start to rip at the ends with two people that combined came to about 210 lbs...<br /><br />The best thing about this product is that it is light , packs very small I could not even pretend one could sleep in this.

The hammock is so colorful and fun.  It is very light weight and feels like a wind breaker you wear on a spring day but it is really durable.  I am so glad to have it!

I am writing  this review to alert people looking for a hammock. First off, prepare yourself because this hammock does not come with anything to hang it with. You need separate lines to use because it only comes with S-hooks at either end. Secondly and mostly importantly if you do end up buying it you really GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. After two days of light use I (a 150 lbs male) fell straight through it when I went to lay down one morning while camping. So despite its claim it can take up to 250 lbs. I wouldn't trust it with anyone over 100 lbs. I wanted to right this review to let people know that this product is horrible, and if your looking for a long-lasting dependable hammock that has everything you are looking for right out of the package look elsewhere.

I bought one for myself some time ago and my stingy girlfriend has been hogging it every time we go out on a hike. So I went ahead and bought her one. It's a great hammock that crams nicely into a little pouch/pocket (attached to hammock). It's pretty lightweight which is super nice.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the first time I bought mine, it came with tree straps. The one I bought for the GF didn't come with any. Bought the same exact hammock from the same vendor. Lame sauce.

First off, the price. At only around $20 this hammock is well worth the money. If you're looking for one of these for backpacking, camping, or just lounging in the yard, this one will do the trick perfectly. The only thing any other product has to offer is that they include straps to connect the hammock to the tree. I simply went down to the local sporting good store and purchased 15 yards of nylon webbing for around $3, cut it in half, tied some basic knots on the ends and was able to easily hang my hammock up between trees distanced 10-15 feet apart. Perfect. Cheap. Great product.

This was my first hammock in attempting this new sleep system for camping and I was not disappointed.  I went out to buy an ENO Double Nest hammock, but still find myself using this one whenever I do multi-day trips because it is so much lighter and less bulky.  I can fit my suspension system, 2 8' pieces of webbing and my hammock and it is still smaller than the ENO itself.  This hammock has proved to be pretty durable.  For the price, this is the best hammock hands down.

packs small but bag is already ripping off the side after just a few uses,  it did not have anything to tie it up with and when lying down you get wrapped up rather tight.<br /><br />Overall I would say spend more and get something that might last more than a few shorts uses.  Although rated to 250 or 300 lb we heard the material start to rip at the ends with two people that combined came to about 210 lbs...<br /><br />The best thing about this product is that it is light , packs very small I could not even pretend one could sleep in this.

The hammock is so colorful and fun.  It is very light weight and feels like a wind breaker you wear on a spring day but it is really durable.  I am so glad to have it!

I bought this hammock for my husband because it was camo.  I, and most of my friends, own ENOs, but ENO didn't make a camo hammock.  Since it's ultralight, it seems a bit smaller than ENOs hammocks, which was an adjustment for my husband because he's 6'5" tall...but he still hops in there and hamms with the rest of us!  I think it's too small for him, but he doesn't seem to mind too much.

I am writing  this review to alert people looking for a hammock. First off, prepare yourself because this hammock does not come with anything to hang it with. You need separate lines to use because it only comes with S-hooks at either end. Secondly and mostly importantly if you do end up buying it you really GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. After two days of light use I (a 150 lbs male) fell straight through it when I went to lay down one morning while camping. So despite its claim it can take up to 250 lbs. I wouldn't trust it with anyone over 100 lbs. I wanted to right this review to let people know that this product is horrible, and if your looking for a long-lasting dependable hammock that has everything you are looking for right out of the package look elsewhere.

I bought one for myself some time ago and my stingy girlfriend has been hogging it every time we go out on a hike. So I went ahead and bought her one. It's a great hammock that crams nicely into a little pouch/pocket (attached to hammock). It's pretty lightweight which is super nice.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the first time I bought mine, it came with tree straps. The one I bought for the GF didn't come with any. Bought the same exact hammock from the same vendor. Lame sauce.

      </div>

First off, the price. At only around $20 this hammock is well worth the money. If you're looking for one of these for backpacking, camping, or just lounging in the yard, this one will do the trick perfectly. The only thing any other product has to offer is that they include straps to connect the hammock to the tree. I simply went down to the local sporting good store and purchased 15 yards of nylon webbing for around $3, cut it in half, tied some basic knots on the ends and was able to easily hang my hammock up between trees distanced 10-15 feet apart. Perfect. Cheap. Great product.

This was my first hammock in attempting this new sleep system for camping and I was not disappointed.  I went out to buy an ENO Double Nest hammock, but still find myself using this one whenever I do multi-day trips because it is so much lighter and less bulky.  I can fit my suspension system, 2 8' pieces of webbing and my hammock and it is still smaller than the ENO itself.  This hammock has proved to be pretty durable.  For the price, this is the best hammock hands down.

packs small but bag is already ripping off the side after just a few uses,  it did not have anything to tie it up with and when lying down you get wrapped up rather tight.<br /><br />Overall I would say spend more and get something that might last more than a few shorts uses.  Although rated to 250 or 300 lb we heard the material start to rip at the ends with two people that combined came to about 210 lbs...<br /><br />The best thing about this product is that it is light , packs very small I could not even pretend one could sleep in this.

So I went ahead and bought her one. It's a great hammock that crams nicely into a little pouch/pocket (attached to hammock). It's pretty lightweight which is super nice.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the first time I bought mine, it came with tree straps. The one I bought for the GF didn't come with any.

      </div>

I bought this hammock for my husband because it was camo.  I, and most of my friends, own ENOs, but ENO didn't make a camo hammock.  Since it's ultralight, it seems a bit smaller than ENOs hammocks, which was an adjustment for my husband because he's 6'5" tall...but he still hops in there and hamms with the rest of us!  I think it's too small for him, but he doesn't seem to mind too much.

I am writing  this review to alert people looking for a hammock. First off, prepare yourself because this hammock does not come with anything to hang it with. You need separate lines to use because it only comes with S-hooks at either end. Secondly and mostly importantly if you do end up buying it you really GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. After two days of light use I (a 150 lbs male) fell straight through it when I went to lay down one morning while camping. So despite its claim it can take up to 250 lbs. I wouldn't trust it with anyone over 100 lbs. I wanted to right this review to let people know that this product is horrible, and if your looking for a long-lasting dependable hammock that has everything you are looking for right out of the package look elsewhere.

      </div>

I bought one for myself some time ago and my stingy girlfriend has been hogging it every time we go out on a hike. So I went ahead and bought her one. It's a great hammock that crams nicely into a little pouch/pocket (attached to hammock). It's pretty lightweight which is super nice.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the first time I bought mine, it came with tree straps. The one I bought for the GF didn't come with any. Bought the same exact hammock from the same vendor. Lame sauce.

For the money this is a great hammock. I am going to get one more soon. I camp a lot and my little girl allway sits in the hammock so i picked this up so i could have one to. I am very happy with it. Thanks

First off, the price. At only around $20 this hammock is well worth the money. If you're looking for one of these for backpacking, camping, or just lounging in the yard, this one will do the trick perfectly. The only thing any other product has to offer is that they include straps to connect the hammock to the tree. I simply went down to the local sporting good store and purchased 15 yards of nylon webbing for around $3, cut it in half, tied some basic knots on the ends and was able to easily hang my hammock up between trees distanced 10-15 feet apart. Perfect. Cheap. Great product.

This was my first hammock in attempting this new sleep system for camping and I was not disappointed.  I went out to buy an ENO Double Nest hammock, but still find myself using this one whenever I do multi-day trips because it is so much lighter and less bulky.  I can fit my suspension system, 2 8' pieces of webbing and my hammock and it is still smaller than the ENO itself.  This hammock has proved to be pretty durable.  For the price, this is the best hammock hands down.

packs small but bag is already ripping off the side after just a few uses,  it did not have anything to tie it up with and when lying down you get wrapped up rather tight.<br /><br />Overall I would say spend more and get something that might last more than a few shorts uses.  Although rated to 250 or 300 lb we heard the material start to rip at the ends with two people that combined came to about 210 lbs...<br /><br />The best thing about this product is that it is light , packs very small I could not even pretend one could sleep in this.

The hammock is so colorful and fun.  It is very light weight and feels like a wind breaker you wear on a spring day but it is really durable.  I am so glad to have it!

I bought this hammock for my husband because it was camo.  I, and most of my friends, own ENOs, but ENO didn't make a camo hammock.  Since it's ultralight, it seems a bit smaller than ENOs hammocks, which was an adjustment for my husband because he's 6'5" tall...but he still hops in there and hamms with the rest of us!  I think it's too small for him, but he doesn't seem to mind too much.

I am writing  this review to alert people looking for a hammock. First off, prepare yourself because this hammock does not come with anything to hang it with. You need separate lines to use because it only comes with S-hooks at either end. Secondly and mostly importantly if you do end up buying it you really GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. After two days of light use I (a 150 lbs male) fell straight through it when I went to lay down one morning while camping. So despite its claim it can take up to 250 lbs. I wouldn't trust it with anyone over 100 lbs. I wanted to right this review to let people know that this product is horrible, and if your looking for a long-lasting dependable hammock that has everything you are looking for right out of the package look elsewhere.

I bought one for myself some time ago and my stingy girlfriend has been hogging it every time we go out on a hike. So I went ahead and bought her one. It's a great hammock that crams nicely into a little pouch/pocket (attached to hammock). It's pretty lightweight which is super nice.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the first time I bought mine, it came with tree straps. The one I bought for the GF didn't come with any. Bought the same exact hammock from the same vendor. Lame sauce.

First off, the price. At only around $20 this hammock is well worth the money. If you're looking for one of these for backpacking, camping, or just lounging in the yard, this one will do the trick perfectly. The only thing any other product has to offer is that they include straps to connect the hammock to the tree. I simply went down to the local sporting good store and purchased 15 yards of nylon webbing for around $3, cut it in half, tied some basic knots on the ends and was able to easily hang my hammock up between trees distanced 10-15 feet apart. Perfect. Cheap. Great product.

This was my first hammock in attempting this new sleep system for camping and I was not disappointed.  I went out to buy an ENO Double Nest hammock, but still find myself using this one whenever I do multi-day trips because it is so much lighter and less bulky.  I can fit my suspension system, 2 8' pieces of webbing and my hammock and it is still smaller than the ENO itself.  This hammock has proved to be pretty durable.  For the price, this is the best hammock hands down.

packs small but bag is already ripping off the side after just a few uses,  it did not have anything to tie it up with and when lying down you get wrapped up rather tight.<br /><br />Overall I would say spend more and get something that might last more than a few shorts uses.  Although rated to 250 or 300 lb we heard the material start to rip at the ends with two people that combined came to about 210 lbs...<br /><br />The best thing about this product is that it is light , packs very small I could not even pretend one could sleep in this.

The hammock is so colorful and fun.  It is very light weight and feels like a wind breaker you wear on a spring day but it is really durable.  I am so glad to have it!

I bought this hammock for my husband because it was camo.  I, and most of my friends, own ENOs, but ENO didn't make a camo hammock.  Since it's ultralight, it seems a bit smaller than ENOs hammocks, which was an adjustment for my husband because he's 6'5" tall...but he still hops in there and hamms with the rest of us!  I think it's too small for him, but he doesn't seem to mind too much.

I am writing  this review to alert people looking for a hammock. First off, prepare yourself because this hammock does not come with anything to hang it with. You need separate lines to use because it only comes with S-hooks at either end. Secondly and mostly importantly if you do end up buying it you really GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. After two days of light use I (a 150 lbs male) fell straight through it when I went to lay down one morning while camping. So despite its claim it can take up to 250 lbs. I wouldn't trust it with anyone over 100 lbs. I wanted to right this review to let people know that this product is horrible, and if your looking for a long-lasting dependable hammock that has everything you are looking for right out of the package look elsewhere.

I bought one for myself some time ago and my stingy girlfriend has been hogging it every time we go out on a hike. So I went ahead and bought her one. It's a great hammock that crams nicely into a little pouch/pocket (attached to hammock). It's pretty lightweight which is super nice.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the first time I bought mine, it came with tree straps. The one I bought for the GF didn't come with any. Bought the same exact hammock from the same vendor. Lame sauce.

First off, the price. At only around $20 this hammock is well worth the money. If you're looking for one of these for backpacking, camping, or just lounging in the yard, this one will do the trick perfectly. The only thing any other product has to offer is that they include straps to connect the hammock to the tree. I simply went down to the local sporting good store and purchased 15 yards of nylon webbing for around $3, cut it in half, tied some basic knots on the ends and was able to easily hang my hammock up between trees distanced 10-15 feet apart. Perfect. Cheap. Great product.

This was my first hammock in attempting this new sleep system for camping and I was not disappointed.  I went out to buy an ENO Double Nest hammock, but still find myself using this one whenever I do multi-day trips because it is so much lighter and less bulky.  I can fit my suspension system, 2 8' pieces of webbing and my hammock and it is still smaller than the ENO itself.  This hammock has proved to be pretty durable.  For the price, this is the best hammock hands down.

packs small but bag is already ripping off the side after just a few uses,  it did not have anything to tie it up with and when lying down you get wrapped up rather tight.<br /><br />Overall I would say spend more and get something that might last more than a few shorts uses.  Although rated to 250 or 300 lb we heard the material start to rip at the ends with two people that combined came to about 210 lbs...<br /><br />The best thing about this product is that it is light , packs very small I could not even pretend one could sleep in this.

","5.0","July 31, 2012","A1ZHKDCYCQBE0R","Great product!","First off, the price. At only around $20 this hammock is well worth the money. If you're looking for one of these for backpacking, camping, or just lounging in the yard, this one will do the trick perfectly. The only thing any other product has to offer is that they include straps to connect the hammock to the tree. I simply went down to the local sporting good store and purchased 15 yards of nylon webbing for around $3, cut it in half, tied some basic knots on the ends and was able to easily hang my hammock up between trees distanced 10-15 feet apart. Perfect. Cheap. Great product."

I bought this hammock for my husband because it was camo.  I, and most of my friends, own ENOs, but ENO didn't make a camo hammock.  Since it's ultralight, it seems a bit smaller than ENOs hammocks, which was an adjustment for my husband because he's 6'5" tall...but he still hops in there and hamms with the rest of us!  I think it's too small for him, but he doesn't seem to mind too much.

I am writing  this review to alert people looking for a hammock. First off, prepare yourself because this hammock does not come with anything to hang it with. You need separate lines to use because it only comes with S-hooks at either end. Secondly and mostly importantly if you do end up buying it you really GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. After two days of light use I (a 150 lbs male) fell straight through it when I went to lay down one morning while camping. So despite its claim it can take up to 250 lbs. I wouldn't trust it with anyone over 100 lbs. I wanted to right this review to let people know that this product is horrible, and if your looking for a long-lasting dependable hammock that has everything you are looking for right out of the package look elsewhere.

      </div>

I bought one for myself some time ago and my stingy girlfriend has been hogging it every time we go out on a hike. So I went ahead and bought her one. It's a great hammock that crams nicely into a little pouch/pocket (attached to hammock). It's pretty lightweight which is super nice.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the first time I bought mine, it came with tree straps. The one I bought for the GF didn't come with any. Bought the same exact hammock from the same vendor. Lame sauce.

For the money this is a great hammock. I am going to get one more soon. I camp a lot and my little girl allway sits in the hammock so i picked this up so i could have one to. I am very happy with it. Thanks

First off, the price. At only around $20 this hammock is well worth the money. If you're looking for one of these for backpacking, camping, or just lounging in the yard, this one will do the trick perfectly. The only thing any other product has to offer is that they include straps to connect the hammock to the tree. I simply went down to the local sporting good store and purchased 15 yards of nylon webbing for around $3, cut it in half, tied some basic knots on the ends and was able to easily hang my hammock up between trees distanced 10-15 feet apart. Perfect. Cheap. Great product.

This was my first hammock in attempting this new sleep system for camping and I was not disappointed.  I went out to buy an ENO Double Nest hammock, but still find myself using this one whenever I do multi-day trips because it is so much lighter and less bulky.  I can fit my suspension system, 2 8' pieces of webbing and my hammock and it is still smaller than the ENO itself.  This hammock has proved to be pretty durable.  For the price, this is the best hammock hands down.

packs small but bag is already ripping off the side after just a few uses,  it did not have anything to tie it up with and when lying down you get wrapped up rather tight.<br /><br />Overall I would say spend more and get something that might last more than a few shorts uses.  Although rated to 250 or 300 lb we heard the material start to rip at the ends with two people that combined came to about 210 lbs...<br /><br />The best thing about this product is that it is light , packs very small I could not even pretend one could sleep in this.

The hammock is so colorful and fun.  It is very light weight and feels like a wind breaker you wear on a spring day but it is really durable.  I am so glad to have it!

I bought this hammock for my husband because it was camo.  I, and most of my friends, own ENOs, but ENO didn't make a camo hammock.  Since it's ultralight, it seems a bit smaller than ENOs hammocks, which was an adjustment for my husband because he's 6'5" tall...but he still hops in there and hamms with the rest of us!  I think it's too small for him, but he doesn't seem to mind too much.

I am writing  this review to alert people looking for a hammock. First off, prepare yourself because this hammock does not come with anything to hang it with. You need separate lines to use because it only comes with S-hooks at either end. Secondly and mostly importantly if you do end up buying it you really GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. After two days of light use I (a 150 lbs male) fell straight through it when I went to lay down one morning while camping. So despite its claim it can take up to 250 lbs. I wouldn't trust it with anyone over 100 lbs. I wanted to right this review to let people know that this product is horrible, and if your looking for a long-lasting dependable hammock that has everything you are looking for right out of the package look elsewhere.

I bought one for myself some time ago and my stingy girlfriend has been hogging it every time we go out on a hike. So I went ahead and bought her one. It's a great hammock that crams nicely into a little pouch/pocket (attached to hammock). It's pretty lightweight which is super nice.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the first time I bought mine, it came with tree straps. The one I bought for the GF didn't come with any. Bought the same exact hammock from the same vendor. Lame sauce.

First off, the price. At only around $20 this hammock is well worth the money. If you're looking for one of these for backpacking, camping, or just lounging in the yard, this one will do the trick perfectly. The only thing any other product has to offer is that they include straps to connect the hammock to the tree. I simply went down to the local sporting good store and purchased 15 yards of nylon webbing for around $3, cut it in half, tied some basic knots on the ends and was able to easily hang my hammock up between trees distanced 10-15 feet apart. Perfect. Cheap. Great product.

This was my first hammock in attempting this new sleep system for camping and I was not disappointed.  I went out to buy an ENO Double Nest hammock, but still find myself using this one whenever I do multi-day trips because it is so much lighter and less bulky.  I can fit my suspension system, 2 8' pieces of webbing and my hammock and it is still smaller than the ENO itself.  This hammock has proved to be pretty durable.  For the price, this is the best hammock hands down.

packs small but bag is already ripping off the side after just a few uses,  it did not have anything to tie it up with and when lying down you get wrapped up rather tight.<br /><br />Overall I would say spend more and get something that might last more than a few shorts uses.  Although rated to 250 or 300 lb we heard the material start to rip at the ends with two people that combined came to about 210 lbs...<br /><br />The best thing about this product is that it is light , packs very small I could not even pretend one could sleep in this.

The hammock is so colorful and fun.  It is very light weight and feels like a wind breaker you wear on a spring day but it is really durable.  I am so glad to have it!

I bought this hammock for my husband because it was camo.  I, and most of my friends, own ENOs, but ENO didn't make a camo hammock.  Since it's ultralight, it seems a bit smaller than ENOs hammocks, which was an adjustment for my husband because he's 6'5" tall...but he still hops in there and hamms with the rest of us!  I think it's too small for him, but he doesn't seem to mind too much.

I am writing  this review to alert people looking for a hammock. First off, prepare yourself because this hammock does not come with anything to hang it with. You need separate lines to use because it only comes with S-hooks at either end. Secondly and mostly importantly if you do end up buying it you really GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. After two days of light use I (a 150 lbs male) fell straight through it when I went to lay down one morning while camping. So despite its claim it can take up to 250 lbs. I wouldn't trust it with anyone over 100 lbs. I wanted to right this review to let people know that this product is horrible, and if your looking for a long-lasting dependable hammock that has everything you are looking for right out of the package look elsewhere.

I bought one for myself some time ago and my stingy girlfriend has been hogging it every time we go out on a hike. So I went ahead and bought her one. It's a great hammock that crams nicely into a little pouch/pocket (attached to hammock). It's pretty lightweight which is super nice.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the first time I bought mine, it came with tree straps. The one I bought for the GF didn't come with any. Bought the same exact hammock from the same vendor. Lame sauce.

      </div>

First off, the price. At only around $20 this hammock is well worth the money. If you're looking for one of these for backpacking, camping, or just lounging in the yard, this one will do the trick perfectly. The only thing any other product has to offer is that they include straps to connect the hammock to the tree. I simply went down to the local sporting good store and purchased 15 yards of nylon webbing for around $3, cut it in half, tied some basic knots on the ends and was able to easily hang my hammock up between trees distanced 10-15 feet apart. Perfect. Cheap. Great product.

This was my first hammock in attempting this new sleep system for camping and I was not disappointed.  I went out to buy an ENO Double Nest hammock, but still find myself using this one whenever I do multi-day trips because it is so much lighter and less bulky.  I can fit my suspension system, 2 8' pieces of webbing and my hammock and it is still smaller than the ENO itself.  This hammock has proved to be pretty durable.  For the price, this is the best hammock hands down.

packs small but bag is already ripping off the side after just a few uses,  it did not have anything to tie it up with and when lying down you get wrapped up rather tight.<br /><br />Overall I would say spend more and get something that might last more than a few shorts uses.  Although rated to 250 or 300 lb we heard the material start to rip at the ends with two people that combined came to about 210 lbs...<br /><br />The best thing about this product is that it is light , packs very small I could not even pretend one could sleep in this.

      </div>

I bought this hammock for my husband because it was camo.  I, and most of my friends, own ENOs, but ENO didn't make a camo hammock.  Since it's ultralight, it seems a bit smaller than ENOs hammocks, which was an adjustment for my husband because he's 6'5" tall...but he still hops in there and hamms with the rest of us!  I think it's too small for him, but he doesn't seem to mind too much.

I am writing  this review to alert people looking for a hammock. First off, prepare yourself because this hammock does not come with anything to hang it with. You need separate lines to use because it only comes with S-hooks at either end. Secondly and mostly importantly if you do end up buying it you really GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. After two days of light use I (a 150 lbs male) fell straight through it when I went to lay down one morning while camping. So despite its claim it can take up to 250 lbs. I wouldn't trust it with anyone over 100 lbs. I wanted to right this review to let people know that this product is horrible, and if your looking for a long-lasting dependable hammock that has everything you are looking for right out of the package look elsewhere.

      </div>

I bought one for myself some time ago and my stingy girlfriend has been hogging it every time we go out on a hike. So I went ahead and bought her one. It's a great hammock that crams nicely into a little pouch/pocket (attached to hammock). It's pretty lightweight which is super nice.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the first time I bought mine, it came with tree straps. The one I bought for the GF didn't come with any. Bought the same exact hammock from the same vendor. Lame sauce.

For the money this is a great hammock. I am going to get one more soon. I camp a lot and my little girl allway sits in the hammock so i picked this up so i could have one to. I am very happy with it. Thanks

First off, the price. At only around $20 this hammock is well worth the money. If you're looking for one of these for backpacking, camping, or just lounging in the yard, this one will do the trick perfectly. The only thing any other product has to offer is that they include straps to connect the hammock to the tree. I simply went down to the local sporting good store and purchased 15 yards of nylon webbing for around $3, cut it in half, tied some basic knots on the ends and was able to easily hang my hammock up between trees distanced 10-15 feet apart. Perfect. Cheap. Great product.

This was my first hammock in attempting this new sleep system for camping and I was not disappointed.  I went out to buy an ENO Double Nest hammock, but still find myself using this one whenever I do multi-day trips because it is so much lighter and less bulky.  I can fit my suspension system, 2 8' pieces of webbing and my hammock and it is still smaller than the ENO itself.  This hammock has proved to be pretty durable.  For the price, this is the best hammock hands down.

packs small but bag is already ripping off the side after just a few uses,  it did not have anything to tie it up with and when lying down you get wrapped up rather tight.<br /><br />Overall I would say spend more and get something that might last more than a few shorts uses.  Although rated to 250 or 300 lb we heard the material start to rip at the ends with two people that combined came to about 210 lbs...<br /><br />The best thing about this product is that it is light , packs very small I could not even pretend one could sleep in this.

The hammock is so colorful and fun.  It is very light weight and feels like a wind breaker you wear on a spring day but it is really durable.  I am so glad to have it!

When bugs aren't an issue this is a great hammock.  If you have issues with bugs I suggest getting one of their hammocks that have bug netting attached.  Grand Trunk hammocks are very well built. Highly recommend them."

When I received it, I immediately tried it out. This hammock is perfect for anyone about 140lbs. I have a lot of confidence in this hammock, I have slept in it a few nights while camping as well. This hammock is extremely easy to assemble and is perfect for hanging in the back yard after a long day of work. The S-Hooks work fine, but if you want piece of mind get some carabiners. Also, make sure you have nothing sharp in your pockets. I am really happy with this purchase."

WARNING no straps come with this item. but you can make some out of rope very easy, if you want to do this watch this video.[...] I did this and it works very well. so i would get this hammock if i were you. i got the forest green and its awesome! as i said earlyer it was raining but it dryed very easy. and its very spacious. Im very small so maybe its just me. [Im only 100 pounds and 5 feet tall.] I cant wait to use it more. Also the s hooks work great and i would not change them for carabiners. i think im going to make a video of this hammock but im not sure.pros  cons---------------------------price  no strapsweightcolorhow quick it drysbonus stuff sackquick shippingsize"

When I first got the first one, it came with two pre-cut ropes to tie to trees. These were ok, but I suggest getting some of this rope:[...]It's easier to tie up without any kind of pre-cut nonsense and the rope still fits perfectly inside this bag when you roll up the hammock. I use mine camping all the time and lay in it with me (180 lbs) my bag (40 lbs) and it holds true. Even added a bunch of snow one time when I woke up in it. The older one hasn't worn at all, I bought the second one for a friend. Do yourself a favor and get this hammock!"
"1132","XX","B001AIBJNS","3.0","April 5, 2012","A2D6EBY15HHGI2","Be careful what you order","I ordered the green version of this over a year ago and loved it. It came with straps and packed down nicely into an attached bag that fit easily in my hand, so it didn't take up any room at all in my backpack.  Unfortunately it got lost on a trip, so I recently had to order another one.  I like blue, so I decided since the product descriptions were the same, surely it'd be the same, travel-friendly hammock I fell in love with.It wasn't.First off, it didn't come with straps, which I see has become a recent issue with them.  But what really bugged me was that it wasn't as portable. The hammock packed down into a much bigger sack which took up too much room in my bags.  I like to travel as light as possible, so a hammock in a bag as big as a notebook doesn't cut it.  I returned the blue one and have decided to try again with the green. Maybe it's a color issue..."
"1133","XX","B001AIBJNS","5.0","April 4, 2012","A3NT2DENUEBZCM","ENO for cheapskates","Following the recent college trend, I wanted to get a hammock that I could hang quickly anywhere on campus, but did not want to fork over $70+ for an ENO. So far this hammock has been the perfect alternative. It packs down to a small stuff sack and weighs close to nothing. I got a little creative and made my own straps, but you can use rope, slap straps, or just about anything else to hang it with."
"1134","XX","B001AIBJNS","4.0","March 25, 2012","A50SHFDNBM19I","portable comfort","This is an absolute must if you have some down time at your campsite.  Get one and watch how quickly your buddies start coming and want to 'test it out'. It's lightweight and packs down small, and at under 20 dollars I would highly recomend getting one."
"1135","XX","B001AIBJNS","3.0","March 25, 2012","ASJ6PJRA0YACK","where are the ropes??????","These are the second and third hammocks of this kind that I have purchased as gifts.  The first one I bought had ropes to wrap around the tree to hang the hammock from.  When I read the other reviews before purchasing many of the top reviews stated that ropes were included.  When I received my shipment of the additional two hammocks, neither one had ropes included. I then read further into the reviews and many people had the same experience.  I don't know if this is a fluke but it makes me wonder how some are arriving with ropes for attachment and some not. So don't expect them and if they come with ropes.......you got a bonus! I will now have to purchase strapes for each new hammock that I just bought."

"1137","XX","B001AIBJNS","5.0","March 14, 2012","A3VRJEZNWLZK4K","Cheap First Hammock","The price is right for anyone wondering if hammock camping is for them.  I got one of them years ago and found that a hammock has advantages over pitching a tent or tarp: it can be set up on a slope, you're off the ground, and it's more comfortable.  The main disadvantage is staying warm. so you'll still need a pad for insulation.If you like using a hammock, then go get a good one.  I got a Hennessy Hammock that I'm happy with.  You should go to their website just to learn to tie the under/over figure eight knot they use.  It's easy to untie and doesn't slip.[...]"
"1138","XX","B001AIBJNS","5.0","March 14, 2012","A22G45DH3MKUTZ","Best purchase in a while","I love this hammock.I bought it in July and its still holding up perfectly in March.I slept in it for a full month (indoors) on a bet and didn't fall out a single night.The fabric still looks and feels new, due to my caution about sharp objects.I hang it with one rope (really an old slackline I decommissioned) and can have it up in less than 5min.The fact that the stuffsack is attached to the side makes it all the better! I empty my pockets into the sack before I lay down.5/5, if this lasts me a full year, I would undoubtedly buy another."

"1140","XX","B001AIBJNS","4.0","March 3, 2012","AMEHDG78V4JHF","You'll Never go back to sleeping pads again.","I just got this today and just had to test it out in the backyard, all i can say is WOW, this with a good sleeping bag in and a small pillow is pure magic. Can't wait to try it out on my next time in the woods, for the first time I will get a good nights sleep (I really hate camping pads).My only issue was that is didn't come with any straps. But that is nothing that can't be fixed with some Webing and paracord. At first I was concerned with how a sleeping bag would work with the rather slick fabric, but it wasn't an issue.One word of advice, make sure your back pockets are empty BEFORE you even sit in the Hammock, the fabric is Very Thin and I am sure it wouldn't take much to tear."
"1141","XX","B001AIBJNS","3.0","February 24, 2012","A1OZL0CN9Y28BE","No Tree Straps","I have to be honest, I was pretty upset when this got here today and it didn't have any tree straps with it.  I was under the impression from looking at the other reviews it would come with some kind of strap.  It didn't so that is another purchase I will have to make.  I do have a lot of military issue 550 chord laying around the house so I may just try and use that.  I have not tried to use the hammock yet so I will update once I have but be advised this does not come with any kind of tree strap and if you don't already have some kind of material to use, add that price to the cost of this item.UPDATE:  I went out and played with this hammock today.  I'm around 220 pounds and it held my weight just fine with some 550 cord as tree straps.  Very comfortable and I'm glad I ordered this product just to get a feel for a camping type hammock.  Keep in mind if you order this product for backpacking or camping, you may have a lot of additional items to order including a mosquito net, tree staps, rain fly, etc.  I have placed an order for the HH deluxe just based off how comfortable this hammock was.  I'll continue to use it just to lounge in and post more updates in the future.Pro:Cheap, cheap, cheapComfortableFairly large (I'm 5'11' and had plenty of room)Con:Lots of added cost to turn this into a camping hammockNo tree straps included'S' hooks (not sure I like those too much as opposed to carabiners)"

It's lightweight, won't rip easy, just a solid purchase. don't forget to buy the straps/rope for hanging up. They aren't included."
"1143","XX","B001AIBJNS","4.0","February 4, 2012","A1PM3KVDGYVGCQ","Grand Trunk","So far I have been quite happy with the product. I'm not certain how it will hold up, and I have read mixed reviews. This didn't deter me from purchasing. I also couldn't be happier with Amazon's customer service. The first shipment disappeared so they overnighted a second one. For that I'm greatful."
"1144","XX","B001AIBJNS","4.0","February 1, 2012","A1NP5AQ87L7ZHR","Great Hammock!!!!","This little hammock is perfect for anyone looking to lounge out on a tight budget. IT fits the body well, is extremely easy to hang up and even has the attached storage bag for convenient storage. It is super lighweight, yet seems pretty sturdy. Unlike a lot of other hammocks of this style, the middle area doesnt ride up when sat in-which is incredibly painful or at least distracting- and the hooks are attached strongly. Lots of reviews have said that they split down the middle after only a few uses- which is understandable considering the strain that the middle section of the material must hold- but even the expensive hammocks will do that. Just be careful when getting in and out of it, and keep sharp objects out of your pockets, and it should last a while. Like anything else, it will last longer the better you take care of it. Ive had mine for about 5 months now and even with regular use it is still in perfect shape. It is even resistant to mold, which is really nice. Overall, this is the perfect hammock for just about anyone that plans on using it casually."
"1145","XX","B001AIBJNS","4.0","January 25, 2012","A3KPX3N09PQI8","Great Hammock","This is a great hammock!  It is hanging from the steel struts in the ceiling of my dorm room, and it is strong enough to take what I throw at it.  No rips or tears, and has easily held me up.  I'm hesitant to put more than 200 lbs in it (stated weight limit) because of how thin it is, but feel like it could hold up.  Still, this is great for napping, reading, and doing work in."
"1146","XX","B001AIBJNS","4.0","January 21, 2012","A3L96MC4ZUU1JG","Worth the money","Good deal for a light hammock.  Iseems a little fragile, but for the price (when on clearance), i'd say its a deal"
"1147","XX","B001AIBJNS","5.0","January 18, 2012","A32MBREFL0R6AB","Tough, surprisingly light, packs really small","It is extremely lightweight and packs very small, like the size of a grapefruit. For the weight it seems pretty tough, I put some strain on it and the seams and threads did not pull. I strung it up today with some paracord and tried it out.  I did not want to get back out again, it was so comfortable and comforting. I love hammock camping because hammocks are so much lighter, smaller, and simpler than tents, and sleeping on the ground hurts my back, even with sleeping pads.You'll need to get some paracord, rope, or straps for it. To make it complete and usable for camping, I bought the paracord, Coghlan's mosquito net for about $3-4, and I already have a small tarp for shelter (I suggest a tarp about 9 feet long to keep rain out). I'll also use the paracord to string up the netting and the tarp.Adjust the length of your ropes or straps you use to attach the hammock to a tree. It goes down when you put your weight in it so it should be nearly horizontal without weight (unlike the picture), unless you like it slung more like an easy chair and less like a bed.This model is so much cheaper (I paid $16) than the models with attached netting (like $40 to $100 or more), and the netting only costs a few dollars separately, so this seemed like the better deal.  I am not at all disappointed."
"1148","XX","B001AIBJNS","1.0","December 31, 2011","A3O8AIH6ITR00T","Perfectly Dissapointing","I purchased this hammock to sleep in on duty days, being on a ship there are plenty of hard points to hang from. However, after 10 fantastic nights, I shifted in my hammock and ended up on the floor.I was worried about the negative reviews, and they were right, I weight 190, and didn't have anything sharp in my pockets nor had shoes on and i still ended up on the deck.  so Buyer beware!  This hammock may work for you but for me it did not."
"1149","XX","B001AIBJNS","5.0","December 30, 2011","A29UR7DU3E6R4T","Grand Trunk Ultralight Hammock","I've been using one of these for about a year with no problems what so ever. I'm 6ft & 190 lbs. My primary use is 3 season light weight hiking/back country camping. I use it with a sil-nylon rainfly, a 3/4 length Ridge Rest SOLite, a light weight sleeping bag, a little DEET40 and sleep like a baby. I used to be a tent guy for all seasons, but have since realized the joys of ultralight hiking (under 20 lb loaded pack for a long weekend; food and water included). BTW: Hammocks are very comfy once you get the diagonal sleeping thing down.  I recently bought another from Amazon for my wife. This one did not come with tree straps, not a big deal when Amazon was nearly giving them away. They set up in less than a minute and take down in less than 30 seconds. I've tried others. In fact my son has an ENO (a bit heavier and more$$) and a friend of mine has a Clark (a lot heavier and big$$$). Though I don't think there's anything quite like a Clark, and the ENO is nice as well, the Grand Trunk is a great hammock and has served it's purpose on many hikes and is still going strong."
"1150","XX","B001AIBJNS","4.0","December 27, 2011","A217UXXG9OTM1Z","Great hammock introduction - Hanging kit NOT INCLUDED IN MINE","I own more hammocks, including the Grand Trunk Skeeter Beeter Pro and this one was a tremendous value and fits its niche perfectly. The description does not match the product I received... it notes ropes are included; not so for me. Still, I sort of figured that and for the price and after reading some other reviews that pointed it out, I am OK with it.This is a simple, hammock day-use system with the possibility of add ons.This is a terrific value. My daughter longed for a Grand Trunk Skeeter Beeter Pro 'just like Daddy's,' but while my daughter is worth the money, I wanted to get her something less expensive in case it wasn't her thing. She was THRILLED with the ultralight and I was impressed with it, too. I look forward to hijacking it for short hikes and single-day kayak trips. It certainly lives up to its name. It's very light and it's also very comfortable.NOTE: It DOES NOT come with additional components. You get a hammock, fit into its own bag, and two S hooks that attach it to a strap system (not included). Some folks say it comes with a suspension system; mine didn't. Hammock, S hooks and bag are what I got for $15. Still, I am happy with the purchase.What else you need:1) Bug net. I'd guess you're looking at $40 for an aftermarket product that is high quality. You may make/stitch something cheaper, but $40 is the starting point of a ready-made net.2) Ridgeline - 100 inches of cord are cheap. Use poly cord, not nylon; nylon stretches. This can cost as little as $1,3) Tarp - a silnylon 9 foot tarp is the minimum. It can go across your ridgeline and you can attach nylon cord for guylines. Estimated cost - $40 for a cheap one. Super light tarps can get very pricy. I find silnylon works fine for me.4) Last but not least, straps. You can buy some for about $15 and this can serve as your suspension system or you can make your own. You can pay more for whoopie slings, strap system, carabiners, special ropes, etc.By the time you're all in, you can count on spending $115. Still a great buy for a hammock system.My advice is know what you want and if cheap, light and simple is the answer, this is a terrific value.EDIT: Being pleased with my first one, I ordered three more: One for my brother, one for my wife and one for my other daughter. Really a great value."

Then when it is up you can use the bag as a cup holder or nic nac holder. It does come with hooks but not chains so you will have to get rope or chain or what not. Personally I plan on using tiedowns that I carry in my truck anyway. Bottom line. For a cheap good hammock. Buy this. I might have to replace it once a year or so, depending on useage, (I am rough on things) but for 12 bucks, I will be more than happy to."

But when I got the hammock it was only 7 feet long, I was really disappointed. I did get the camo one so idk if it is because it is a patterned print so they make them shorter, and if it is true they should specify that they are shorter, and I would have goten a solid print instead, but a good hammock other than being short very light, and the fabric is thin and makes me a little nervous, but i trust it, and holds me well, would recommend to someone who was looking for a light weight backpacking hammock."

They've held close to 200lbs and so far, so good. They are extremely lightweight and pack up easily in their little pouch, but yet they actually keep us pretty warm. Since they are so lightweight, I would probably not recommend them for long-term use for larger people. My hubby and I are both under 150 and have smaller builds and these are perfect for us and our young boys. In fact, there's enough fabric to drape over us to keep heat in. These come with rope and can be put in very quickly. We plan on buying several and having them on hand. The only reason these don't get a 5-star rating is because I wish the fabric was just a bit thicker. I'd give 4.5 stars if  could! :)"

The material is not as soft as a parachute hammock is, but it is far from uncomfortable.  The lack of cross supports at each end enables you to wrap yourself in the hammock for a little bit of warmth from the elements.  I recommend replacing the hooks it comes with with carabeaners.  150lbs weight limit Carabeaners on each with be enough to support the hammocks 250lbs wait limit.  Do not use and stretchable rope to support it or you will sink inside two weeks.  If attaching your hammock to a vertical pole, use a prusic knot with a loop and you will be fine.  I recommend 550 paracord or equivilent for your rope.  I hope this helps and I absolutely recommend this hammock.-Justin"

It had some great reviews. And no, I ain't a lard ass, I weigh about 150 lbs. Checked my pockets to see if I had a knife or something sharp on me that would have cut the hammock, but I was clean.

None came with ropes long enough to span the distance between most hanging points I would find hiking.  To be honest - I have found that 1' woven mesh works perfectly for hanging my hammocks - it has very little elasticity - so your hammock hangs where you put it (eliminating the need to overtension the hammock before you get in).This hammock is comparable in construction to the ultralight byer hammocks I have owned in the past.  It is, however, larger and safely accomodates my 260# frame without difficulty.  By sleeping slightly diagonal in it, I am able to lie close to flat.  The enlarged height and width allow me to go a bit more diagonal than in a byer, so I get a more comfortable resting position.I have also found that the ropes are shorter than those on a byer.  Since neither is long enough and you have to bring your own tree ropes anyway, this is not an issue.One difference though.  The hammocks of this material that have different colors sewn together can be stronger due to those seams (or weaker) depending upon quality of construction.  The seams help reduce some of the elasticity of the hammock and allow you to lie a bit flatter because of it.  This one piece cloth hammock has a tendency to 'coccoon' over you if you go off diagonal and lie in line with the attachment points.  I have found that just hanging a foot or elbow off the corresponding sides reduces the tendency for a side to raise up and lets me see what's going on just fine.  With traditional rope hammocks you do not have this to deal with though.One final caveat:  For 20 bucks for a hammock you can fit into a cargo pocket - it's quite a deal.  It may not be as comfortable as a larger rope hammock in the long run, but those things are HUGE and HEAVY - I would not consider taking one car camping, let alone backpacking.  This one goes with me everywhere."

If you are interested in hammock camping or just want a cheap hammock...then this might help you out.I haven't had the chance to actually try this hammock out camping but I have strung it up in the backyard and tested it. It works wonderful although it does require some practice stringing it up for the first time. The fabric is a nylon-feeling material (like a windbreaker jacket) so it's very stain/mess resistant (as well as mildew apparently).I'm 6'2' and 155lbs and the hammock was still very roomy. Although I doubt it's ability to hold up to 250 as advertised...maybe?I don't like the ropes that came with it, they are much too short for any tree distance scenario you might run into in the woods. I replaced these with two rope sets of 500lb paracord. Cut off two 8ft sections, tied some knots in each of the strands, and strung it up. It feels more 'bungee' at first...but has held up so far.Overall, an awesome alternative to a tent in the summer heat. Some have used these for winter camping...I may brave it and try myself.Also, I've read that the Coghlan's Double Mosquito Net works well with this hammock."

"1212","XX","B001AIBJNS","4.0","March 2, 2011","A3TDTN1L7ZH04H","GT Ultralight Hammock","Bought this as a trial run for a hammock, since it was priced so well.  Intending to hike the AT (Appalachian Trail) this summer and for a number of reasons, hammocks caught my attention.Spent a few nights each (myself and wife) in the hammock in the basement.  Takes a little bit to find the comfy spot (hammocks in general are that way I am told), but slept good once we did.Will be buying the lighter weight Grand Trunk Nano 7 for my wife..Gave it just 4 stars, as the suspension is not quite sufficient for a variety of hangs/tree distances."
"1213","XX","B001AIBJNS","5.0","March 1, 2011","A9RTRKZM3IEOY","Comfortable Hammock, Great Value","This really is a terrific hammock and is a steal at the price they are going for.  I've been using mine for months and below are some points based on my experience with it so far:Quality:  This hammock is extremely lightweight and not built as tough as some others out there.  While very light, the material seems to be of good quality and has held up well so far.  They've really given you a lot of material, as I can nearly wrap myself up in it, burrito-style, when lying in it.  (Reviewer is 6'2' and 185 lbs. for reference)  The edges are nicely finished and the ends are nicely and securely bound.  When lying in it, there do seem to be points at which the fabric is more stressed than others, but I can't find any rips or tears in the fabric or at the stitching after much use.  The hammock comes with a set of knotted cord to use for suspension between points.  They could be a bit longer to suit me, but have performed just fine.  Despite the relatively narrow gauge cord, they are high quality and have not abraded or stretched unusually.  The hammock comes with 'S' hooks rather than carabiners, but they work well.Lightweight:  As I mentioned, this is one light hammock.  It may not matter if you're using it in your back yard, but this baby is a real weight-saver if you are packing it in on your back.  It packs to nearly nothing in terms of size, and in terms of size and weight it amounts to about the same as three pairs of hiking socks.  It is hard to beat for a minimalist trip to the back country in fair weather.  Should it get wet, or after you wash it, it dries super quick, providing a bit of sun...Comfort:  There really is nothing like the slumber you get gently swaying in a hammock.  The only thing I can compare it to is the sleep one gets on a gently rocking boat.  This particular hammock is very comfortable, with just the right amount of give and plenty of size to change positions and stretch out.Durability:  So far, so good.  Though I've used it frequently, I've also used it very gently:  No shoes, no keys in the back pocket, no dropping in it cannonball-style.  Even gently lowering myself in, a couple of times I've heard stress 'pops' where the fabric gathers at the ends as it takes my weight, though I've not detected any damage.  The S hooks have worn well, and I have been very impressed with the suspension cords that came with it.  The cord hasn't stretched as far as I can tell, and despite the relatively small diameter, they have shown only minimal abrasion wear due to tree bark, posts, etc.  With careful use, this baby has treated me right for a long time.Value:  This one is huge.  A quality hammock, S hooks, stuff bag (attached to the hammock so it won't get lost), AND a set of knotted suspension cords all for a little more than a large pizza with two toppings??  Are you kidding me?!  (OK, so there may be some regional differences on the price of the aforementioned pizza.  Still!)  I would have expected - and been happy with - well under the use I've already had out of this, and it's still going.  Massive value here, especially when you consider that you could get two or three of these for the price of some other hammocks...Other thoughts:  I love this hammock, I would buy it again in a second, and I can totally recommend it.  However...  Keep in mind this is a lightweight - stop, read ULTRAlight - hammock.  I've used it much, though gently, and it has worked great.  Ultimately, I would not expect it to last as long as something a bit heavier.  Now, this may or may not matter depending on your use, how much you weigh, how often you use it, etc.  Personally, I would think twice about relying on this as my only source of accommodation for an extended trip in the back country - I'd want either a slightly heavier hammock or a back up in addition.  Mind you, mine has yet to fail.People have asked me about upgrading to carabiners.  Frankly, I think they are superfluous for this purpose as the S hooks are perfectly good and secure, and it's the fabric that will give long before the S hooks.  Still, if you've already got them, then go for it.For the quality and price, this one just can't be beat.  Get it, kick back, and relax.  Heartily recommended at five stars."

I wasn't willing to spend alot and didn't want one that would need to be stored after every use.  When I viewed this one I was sure that it was too cheap to last very long, but at least I would find out if I would use a hammock or not.  I was pleased with the weight and ease of installation, but really impressed with the comfort level.  This is one tough hammock and very comfortable.  I made the mistake of having our burn pit too close and some sparks actually burned small holes in about 10 areas.  This, I was sure, was going to be the end of my hammock because surely it would cause it to rip.  Not one burn hole has begun to rip.  My husband, who is close to the weight limit, loves this hammock and has one of his own.  Buying this hammock was originally an experiment to see if we would get any use out of our hammocks prior to buying one that is more expensive.  After using this hammock for 3 months I can't imagine buying a different hammock.  This is great for camping or enjoying in your own back yard."

I use it in my day pack as an 'in case I get stranded overnight' solution when I'm hiking and fishing away from my normal load I carry in the canoe's big bag.I've also lent this hammock to others ranging from my 14 yr old son, to my wife, to a buddy who on nite two of our trip was insanely jealous of my NOT hurting back while he took 2 hours to 'limber up' after his night on the ground.My number 1, all the time hammock is a system - the claytor jungle hammock - it's hammock, bug tent, and tarp all in one, it's quite huge compared to this and weighs 3 pounds all together (more than 3x this) and makes a giant area I can live under, cook under, etc.  BUT for a day hike emergency, a back up, or a loaner - this hammock is perfect.I carry a few ounces of painters drop cloth with Duct Tape on the corners for an emergency tarp with this Grand Trunk hammock, and a mosquito head net, all inside the same stuff sack that's attached to it, and it works fine...in a pinch...which is why I'm carrying it.It also can be made to condense much smaller than it arrives - just wind the tree straps into a smaller ball, roll the hammock really tight, use some rubber bands...and you can get this into the size of a softball or grapefruit easily.

The cord system that comes with it worked very well and it was easy to set up.It did however, get static buildup if you roll around in it, as I did when testing it out, but once you put blankets in and get stationary that wasn't a problem. It is a pretty comfortable one person hammock, and is big enough that you are almost cocooned inside. But blankets didn't work very well with it, they kept sliding down, because the hammock's not very flat when you're in it, so I would suggest a sleeping bag inside as well if it's cold.And as usual I think with all hammocks, you lose body heat really easily at night, so I did get freezing in it, but so did the other campers with me, with different types of hammocks so I don't think that was a particular shortfall of this one. It seems to be more of a sleep hammock than a relax hammock, although it could work like that I beleive. Also it packs up really tiny in the bag that's connected to it so that was a great feature.All in all it was very functional and inexpensive and I'm happy I bought it."

One of the joys of this trip is hooking up my hammock to a couple trees and chilling out while reading a book.Prior to getting this hammock, I had used a very inexpensive, braided nylon hammock. It was about as basic as you could get... just nylon braided rope with a couple metal rings at either end. The major problem is that after a few minutes, I'd have severe rope mark indentations in my skin if I didn't first line the hammock with my sleeping bag. But it packed very small (about the size of an orange), was light-weight and worked like a champ. It could also be used to hoist food into the air at night to keep food away from marauding animals.This Ultralight Hammock ( I got the Royal Blue color ) is so much better though. It is also lightweight, but since it is not a braided hammock it is much more comfortable. Plus the integrated storage 'pocket' makes a great place to stash a paperback book while you're dozing off in the hammock. The included S-hooks and pre-knotted rope are so easy to use when hooking your hammock up to trees. I was a little skeptical that the S-hook and knots would work as well as they do but after many 'hangings' I've never been let down (pun intended) inadvertently.This is such a nice addition to my camping equipment that I can't imagine ever being without it on a camping trip. I'm no lightweight at 215 pounds and this hammock holds me just fine.Love the Ultralight Hammock. I'm going to find a photo of me and my hammock and post it in the customer image area."

"1227","XX","B001AIBJNS","5.0","October 26, 2010","AU4VXUQLYMUX4","Works well and reasonable price","Roomy for single person but not a double person hammock.If you lie crosswise your feet will probably hang off, but if you lie diagonally you can lie almost flat and have a bit extra to wrap around you to keep off the breeze.Comes with S-hooks and two 5-foot long (when doubled over) support ropes. The ropes are doubled over with knots tied at intervals so you can attach one end to a hook in a wall or tree (better not to put hooks in trees though) and attach the S-hook to a suitable knot for the height you want. The ropes aren't long enough to wrap around trees unless they are small and really close together, but there was plenty for our set-up where we had two posts with hooks in them. We tied an extra knot in the rope to fine-tune.  You can get similar rope pretty cheaply, special hammock straps, or I've read suggestions elsewhere about adapting non-nylon (nylon stretches) vehicle tie-down straps. Others have suggested replacing the s-hooks with carabiners which sounds nice but 2 of the carabiners I priced would cost more than the hammock! A carabiner might be slightly more secure but I doubt the hammock will jump off a s-hook if there's weight on it.The fabric is thin but strong and cool. For coolish weather lie on a thin blanket.Once we had things adjusted for our location it takes about 30 seconds to put up the hammock.I read reviews about this hammock and several others before deciding on this one. Others may have a bit more structure, but for the price this one seems to do pretty much what a hammock needs to do without making it a major family financial investment decision."

My other held my buddy who weighs 205.  We actually slept them bunkbed style since we only had two trees on the site that'd work.  Now they held us fine, however, if you toss or turn in your sleep or like to sleep on your side this isn't the overnight hammock for you.  GREAT dayhike hammock and if you're a nonmover when you sleep it'll be perfect, but I had to wake up enough to be coherant enough to gently adjust myself.  The one time I got too comfortable with the hammocks integrity and just rolled over it sounded like fibers ripping.  Now the hammock didn't rip that I can see but it was enough to respect it's delicacy the rest of the trip, especially with my buddy underneath my hammock.So all in all, it's GREAT for the price, GREAT for dayhikes, GREAT for kids and GREAT for recreational events.  Sleeping overnight, even though I love my GT, I got an ENO double so I didn't have to worry about it giving on me while adjusting throughout the night.  Ropes on the GT work fine but 550 paracord works just as well if you need more length (I did this exact thing and worked perfectly)All in all great for the price and as far as weather protection just get a cheap tarp from walmart.  An 8x10 was big enough to cover our hammocks and put a camp chair under and wait out the 6 straight hours of rain we ended up getting.  We were off the ground and bone dry.

I didn't even realize it came with the ropes when I purchased it. They make this fully adjustable for various spaces. The instructions for using the ropes are very easy to understand, and I had this up in under a minute. Fabric is cool and breathable, and so easy to wrap up into the attached bag. This is just as good as another brand I had that was double this price! It comfortably supported my husband who is 175 lbs. Ordering another one today and I plan to give many as gifts.***Update, 5/2011: I purchased 2 of these. After only owning one for 7 months, it split right down the middle, dropping me to the ground. No, I'm not fat, didn't have anything sharp in my pocket, and wasn't using it incorrectly. I contacted the manufacturer who wanted me to pay to ship it back to them so they could mail me a replacement. I didn't feel like paying $6.00+ to ship an item that was only $16 to begin with, so I just took it as a loss, and used my second one cautiously. Yesterday, the second one I own (which is now 10 months old) just did the exact same thing and split right down the middle as the first! This is VERY thin, and there's just no way that it can withstand multiple uses over a long period of time. Invest in one that is thicker. So disappointed because I LOVED it at first.  Guess you get what you pay for. Be careful!!***Update, 6/29/2011: After both of mine ripped, I contacted the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I felt like maybe there was an issue with the manufacturing and wanted to make sure no one else would get hurt. They sent my report to Grand Trunk, and I received a call from their office. The guy I spoke to was extremely friendly and apologetic. He ensured me that it wasn't a common issue, but that they have had other complaints over the years. Because the material is so thin, it doesn't take much to puncture it, thus causing it to possibly rip. I mean, it's less than $20, so I get that. He wanted to make it right, and sent me a replacement right away, but gave me the model that's thicker and more durable. Fantastic customer service. I'd go ahead and just purchase the thicker hammock made for 400 pounds. The company is great, and I'll certainly continue to purchase from them after they did what was necessary to make me a happy customer again."

These hammocks do not pinch you inward making it very comfortable.A tip to you campers, use just one line between points (utilize a prusik knot for tension) and let the hammock drape from that single rope. You can now use that same line for your rain fly or your mosquito netting. You save on weight and you don't have to cut your rope.I uploaded video to a popular website (wink) of the hammock and how to use the single line method with a mosquito net!

The Grand Trunk hammocks are perfect for kids, but also for smaller adults.  They are super light-weight.  I took the advice of one reviewer and immediately replaced the 'S hooks' with screw-type oval hooks that I got at Lowe's ($2.00 each). We used all 3 hammocks camping this weekend and all of them performed well.  The Grand Trunk hammocks, though, were much lighter material, and with a small breeze, kept you much cooler in the hot/humid climate in Texas )it was over 90 this weekend).  I think the ENO hammock will outperform the Grand Trunk hammocks in the cooler months as it is bigger and the thicker parachute nylon.  But for summer camping, and for children/small adults  - for the price - I would definitely recommend the ultralight Grand Trunk hammocks.Also, they do come with ropes that are easy to use, and very sturdy."

My buddy has a high quality kind of the same style that he takes on every backpacking trip he goes on, that way he does not need to pack a sleeping mat or tent (he also has a rain fly for his that he purchased separately). I never tried his out but liked the idea so much that I searched for one of the cheapest hammocks of this style and this is the one I found. I actually love it, but the ropes it came with are not too practical because they are quite short which limits the versatility of where to put it up, but you can get any other length of rope for pretty cheap almost anywhere that will make this much more versatile.The first time I used it I set it up at a children's park in between the play structures while my brother had baseball practice. I just wanted to test it by laying in it and reading a book, but when I sat in it something popped and it fell slightly. It ended up being because of the way the construction of the hook is attached to the hammock. I am 6'2' and 145lbs (so I doubt it will hold 300lbs comfortably but I could be wrong). When this happened it didn't break, but it frayed the rope attached to the hammock a little bit. Since then I have yet to have a problem. It IS pretty comfortable and I actually carry it with me in my school backpack when attending college, that way I can kick back and relax or study outside whenever the weather permits it.I would recommend this item, like I said, to anyone who is skeptical about this style and doesn't want to invest in an expensive one.

My 9 year old son is now starting to backpack with us and wanted to sleep in a hammock like his dad and big brother.  I wasn't sure how much he would really like it so I bought this one because you can't really go wrong for 18 bucks.The quality seems good and I think it seems more durable than some other reviewers have reported.  My son loves the silky feel and how it wraps him in securely when he sleeps.  He played with it pretty roughly in the back yard the day it came and it didn't seem any worse for wear.We took it camping this last weekend.  He slept in it under a tarp in the rain all night.  In the morning he was so excited to tell everyone he had slept out in a hammock all night.  He was comfortable and slept well.  He like it so much that he has slept in it in the back yard the last 2 nights.  It seems to be holding up well and has been a quality purchase.The stated weight limit on this hammock is 250 lbs.  I figure I weigh 220, so if I started swinging or bounced a little in it, the force would quickly exceed that limit.  Seems to be more appropriate for kids or pretty small adults.  The sturdier hammocks from this brand hold up to about 450 lbs (i think).  That is what I use and I have probably logged about 50 nights in mine.Great value for 18 bucks.

I've used the Grand Trunk Ultra about 20 times and it was great. It holds my weight fine, 175 pounds, but I'm hesitant to let my kids lay in the hamock with me since reading more than a few reviews about it ripping while lying in it. I have to make my 5 and 7 year old kids take turns if they want to lay in it with me. Just a overprotective dad i guess.I always knew that if I really liked these types of hammocks that I would purchase a sturdier hammok and keep this as the hammock I use and abuse, throw in the car, lay in dirty, hot, and sweaty after yard work or completely wet from swimming....for the price it's perfect.I ended up buying the Kammok in nakura blue/stone gray since I was so impressed with the python straps, quality stitching, and to be honest the cool color.

I have strung them up between two trees at a camping site and almost decided to just spend the night there.  Strung up on the beach between snorkels and you know you're in heaven.  One day we ended up having to wait at a little airport all day for a plane, so I hung it between a tree and a chain linked fence.  I just don't travel on vacation without it!  Very light, and amazingly strong.  I weigh about 230, and there is no hint of strain or being close to any limit.  Amazing how such a thin material can be so strong.  I have occasionally found that there are not enough trees located within the range of adjustment of the ropes that come with the hammocks, so I made some knotted rope extensions that greatly increase the flexibility of where to hang it.  The self-storing pocket is large enough that I can even stuff my two ropes per hammock into the pocket with the hammock.  Even needing to do this (instead of having longer ropes come with that hammock) cannot move me off a 5-star rating.  I really love these hammocks!"

The only reason I don't love it is I feel like I'm at it's Max weight limit ( I'm 196 Lbs.) as the ultra light material is very thin.

That being said for the price you can't beat it, if you are wondering if you would like this style hammock or not it is a good starter.  I am looking at upgrading to an eno brand hammock now because I tried one out and it is way more durable and comfortable.  This summer I plan on camping from it and I just don't trust this one as much because the material is so fragile. Mine has some pin sized holes in it and I don't know if they are going to eventually run and split the material.  Also the material it is made of makes my hair really staticy and the eno brand one doesn't.  For not it is great for what I do but I plan on upgrading to something more durable in the future.  One complaint is if you don't lay right in the center of it it makes an uncomfortable ridge down the middle so you have to keep your feet over the ridge to make your body lay in the middle.  I think either mine has stretched some or I am more used to laying in it because I don't have the problem as much as when I first got it."

All three have survived for over two years with steady use. This includes use by two less than careful teenagers and their friends, who leave hammocks out in the rain for several days...The S-hooks have worked fine, although replacing them with a set of load-rated carabiners would probably make one feel more confident in the setup.I would buy this hammock again.

I have tried out many hammocks both costly and cheap in my quest for the best one in relation to camping, these include DD Frontline Hammock (which I own), EMO, textsport and others. This has been my best hammock so far.This hammock is as comfortable as many of the expensive ones (as long as you aren't too tall, I am 6'1' and its fine), and yet it is also the lightest I've found comprehensively browsing all which exist out there (with the exception of the nano from grand trunk as well... if you're willing to pay 3 times the price). I used it on a month long biking tour through France and England, and it held up great. It was always the thing to look forward too at night. I would rather sleep in this in the woods then have someone kindly invite us over for the night; cause with this I would get a good night's sleep.There just isn't any price/weight/comfort ratio to match this bargain out on the market!

I put some of the Grand kids pool toys in it, swim masks, sunscreen, etc. I have a big bin already for beach towels that sits by the door, this would good for those too. I put 3 large and thick square chair pads in it, and it would probably have held one or two more.I'm not using it for those, just wanted to see if they would fit.

Either the FedEX man has started ripping my packages open with his teeth and flinging them into the yard, or... it probably is the two young puppies from next door.It requires assembly, but no tools!  It is snap together six pieces.  It is well designed and thought out, the interleaving of the corners makes for a sturdy unit, no problem to use as a seat.  There might be an issue with over-stuffing with deck cushions, but the Panasonic NB-G110P toaster oven (from Amazon, of course) fits inside nicely.  And no teeth marks!The delivery guys have no problem figuring out to use it, (just problems chasing the aforementioned young pups out of the delivery truck) so if you live in a rural area, it is a pretty good idea for a UPS/FedEx 'stuff' box.  Since it is waterproof, it is also good for the environment in the sense that they can stop wrapping the deliveries in plastic on the rainy days."

That's when I saw this in Target, I had seen them online, but never in person and it was much larger and nicer quality than I had expected. Being a lover of Amazon I immediately checked to see if it was available. I got it for $10 cheaper with free 2 day prime shipping and love it! Its not too big, not too small and I can fit all kinds of things in it (e.g. extension cord, car wash stuff, water hose etc...) So far so good, its kept all my belongings clean, dry, and bug free. It was easy to put together by myself (literally took 2 minutes) although I did read previous reviews about others putting theirs together wrong and ruining it. So I did follow the directions as others have mentioned, you MUST put certain pieces together first as it says in the instructions, because once its together you CANNOT take it apart!

The grilling one holds several long-handled grilling tools, cleaning supplies, bowls, plates and serving supplies.

The gardening one holds pots, gardening tools, bags of soil, orchid bark, sand and salt for breaking up ice, etc.I am a believer that even your storage containers should look like furniture and that your outdoor space is an extension of your home, so I appreciate that these are attractive as well as spacious, useful, convenient, and sturdy. They were really easy to assemble as well. They are also pretty secure from curious wild animals and have a tight closure to keep out inclement weather. I haven't had them tested in the snow and freezing cold yet, but I am confident that they will handle it.

That was a pain in the neck having to walk back and forth to the shed every time it was going to rain.  So I decided to buy seat covers for the chairs and then I purchased this small container to store the seat covers.  I keep this handy storage on the deck too!  It's so much more convenient and easy to fold and store the covers before the rain comes.  The container looks exactly as it does in the picture.  It has that wicker look made of heavy duty plastic.  I wouldn't recommend adults to sit on it regularly, but my kids love to sit on this container. It's sturdy, compact, convenient for storing covers and attractive considering it's plastic.

I recommend lining up the pieces in order A-F then following the 6 steps in the instructions.  Each piece has slots and tabs.  Line up the pieces to be adjoined (tab to slot) and press it down until it clicks.  Made of durable resin.  We use the one on the back deck as extra seating too.  Looks nice and cleans up easily.

A few days later, my husband said we needed a new storage box for his charcoal on the deck.  He was trying to move it with his foot and kicked a hole through the side of it.  He looked it over and found another hole that had been kicked in it.  This was just a basic storage box but apparently it was not for outdoor use.  I had already looked at this and checked the reviews so we decided to give it a try.  We love it  This holds not only his charcoal but his chimney starter, utensils, wood chips, newspapers to start the charcoal, his horse shoes, his washers game, outdoor lights, citronella candles, and who knows what else!  It was SOOOO easy to put together.  I am blind (yes, that's right) and I put it together with only the help of our 8-week old puppy.  She did an excellent job of chewing on the bottom piece of the box.  There was no damage whatsoever!  I am confident that this deck box is strong and sturdy and will last for several years.***Here's an update...7 months later and we still love it!  We have added some other storage bins inside to keep it a bit more organized.  Those newspapers and wood chips were everywhere!  It is surprisingly easy to open and close but not have to worry about rain getting inside.  Everything stays dry. It even makes a great seat when I don't want to pull the cushions out for the patio chairs. My puppy did continue to chew on one corner of the lid for a while.  She roughed up the corner a tiny bit but not enough for it to cause any problem whatsoever.  (I can't say the same for the hammock, she ate through the entire thing!)  I would not hesitate to buy another one!"

These will make great extra seating on the back patio.It has rained the last three days straight, and I've checked occasionally, no moisture inside at all.My only gripe is the tiny warping in the one, and that the lid doesn't seal shut, it closes with a slight gap, but appears to be designed that way.  The wind and rain havn't gotten in, but I wouldn't spray them with a hose and expect the contents to be bone dry.Overall, very happy with the purchase.  This was the light beige one.

Unfortunately, the small hinged portion on top of the lid is not at all weather-tight and fills will rain water. The rain water then runs down the two slots cut for the gas-assist cylinders into the interior or the box where it puddles in the bottom since there is no outlet for it.Also, the hinges on the top lid failed after two months and probably no more than 12-15 openings and closings. They are extremely an extremely small molding given the size of the lid and the force put on it by the gas-assist cylinders. However, at the Suncast site I was able to order a new lid under warranty, so it may be that the new lid will have better-designed hinges. If not, I'll probably be ordering a new lid every few months until the warranty runs out.My recommendation from this point forward would be to get a box with a one-piece domed lid and hope the hinging mechanism is better designed than this one. I'll fill the slots where the cylinders attach to the lid with silicone and that should stop the water caught in the top tray from spilling down inside the box. However, the tray will still catch water when it rains so the only real recourse to standing water in the lid is to seal the whole thing shut with silicone, thus creating a one-piece lid.I hope Suncast reads these reviews and asks the designer (or design team) 'What were you thinking?' when you designed the box this way. I don't expect an inexpensive deck box to be a water-tight vault, but an inch of standing water in the bottom of the box just doesn't cut it...and the box is in a somewhat rain-protected area.I'd be willing to give Suncast another try given the ease with which warranty service is provided, but I would definitely read over the reviews much more closely next time."

I do believe the best use for this is for large, light, cumbersome items.  I use it for big plastic trucks, t-ball bats and balls, badminton racquets et al, and bubbles/water guns.

In the box now are two, short metal trash cans with lids. Two 25 pound bags of seed. Several of those large, popcorn tins, that now hold birdseed. And a whole miscellany of feeders of various sizes.The very size and depth of the box can makeit difficult to reach things on the bottom of the box. I built and installed a free-standing shelf, about a foot high, on one side of the box for placement of small items and easy access. The built in lid storage tray is wonderful and even has an indentation in the middle to make it easier to open.  It is divided into three compartments in which Mrs. Spudman keeps things like gloves, clippers, hooks, and bird treats. The tray's lid doesn't always close smoothly, and needs a little extra encouragement. Not closing this compartment snugly means all of its contents could fly out when the large lid is raised.Most people will place their deck boxes on a deck, porch, or patio.  That wouldn't work in our situation since the box contains birdseed for the feeders and a deck placement would require too many trips up and down the steps. Instead I made an elevated platform using cinderblocks and 2 by 4s on which to situate the new box. Its raised position enables Mrs. Spud easier access to the contents, and its ground location eliminates all those trips up the steps.FinallyThis box suits and will suit our purposes perfectly. We like its size and the extra storage in the lid. Those who don't need a box of this size and favor mobility may want to shop for a box equipped with wheels and handles. Our box is stationary. I wouldn't want to struggle with moving this thing. As more stuff has found its way inside the box, the steadiness and stability of the box has actually improved."

It keeps out the water, has holes to add your own latch or lock, and was an absolute breeze to assemble (3 minutes, tops).  It stays together when moving from place to place (even if full).  It looks OK, given that it's a plastic monstrosity.  The color is neutral enough to blend in with just about anything.I only detract one star because of a few things that would improve it greatly -- it could use some wheels, or at least handles or imprints so it could be gripped/moved with much more ease.  It is sturdy enough to sit on (even my 250+ pound friend had no problem sitting on it), so if they had simply molded the lid in a seat shape, this would have had far more function.As a side note: Do not pay the inflated shipping charge, it is not worth that.

The top is reinforced with plastic crossbracing as part of the mold, so it's fairly strong - a 250 pound person can gingerly sit upon the sides or corners, but we're not going to test for the breaking point &lt;grin>.  It is not watertight (although not necessarily leaky - just no seal where the pieces snap together and where the top rests), but unless you get driving rain or flooding, I don't think this would be much of a problem.

I am using the  DB5000 Deck Box on ground level with its primary purpose being to house a light weight small auto vacuum ( wheeled Sears shop vac type). No more lugging the vacuum from inside the house and back again. Located 10' from 3 vehicles, no excuse for a weekly interior cleanup. Perfect fit and  Water proof ( has not leaked yet). One minor problem for this application was when placed on the mulch the floor of the box did rise up ( its placed in, not locked in) The cure was putting a small 2'x6'brick  under each leg of the box, keeping the box level and the floor in place."

It has now been outside for over a week with no discoloration or weathering.The main drawbacks really are the cheap assembly, the hinges don't feel strong and the bottom isn't really secured by anything other than gravity.

The box itself is attractive and does not add an unsightly element to the deck.  Although we have not used them as seats, I'm sure they can be used as extra seating if needed (they are very sturdy).

We rarely get rain but, when we do, it's usually a thunderstorm with high winds and a downpour for about 5 - 10 minutes.  The box held up well for those types but did not do as well for a huge storm that lasted over an hour.  Not typical for us but the box did not keep out the water so now we know.  That is the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5.  I could not find any outdoor box that could keep out the rain 100%.

We have a 9 ft umbrella and it broke the stand within minutes.First of all though lets talk about the hassle of getting the sand in the base. I bought the driest sand I could find after reading similar complaints about how difficult it was. I fashioned a make-do funnel out of a soda bottle and me and my friend spent well over an hour getting the sand into the base, its hard work.After filling it with sand and looking at the very flimsy plastic screw which holds the stand to the base i tentatively placed our umbrella in. It was wobbling all over the place without any wind at all. It settled in a 1pm clock position and didnt look like it was going to stay there. With just the crappy plastic screw at the bottom and the metal screw on the side to secure it, it never stood a chance. I took the pole  out and tightened the screw at the bottom with some pliers hoping this would help a little. It did just a bit so I left it there, still leaning, about half an hour.Before I retired inside I took the umbrella out of the stand, as I didnt trust it enough to leave it overnight, and moved the base out of the way, it was then that I found that the screw at the bottom which holds the stand to the base had snapped clean off.Im now in the process of getting a refund and Amazon have asked me to return the item. Ive attempted getting the sand back out of the base... If you think getting it in the base is a struggle wait til you try to get it out!Absolute waste of time, dont buy this if you have anything bigger than a cocktail umbrella. Very poor quality."

Based on other reviews, the first thing I did was cut off the locking part of the cap. The cap seems to stay on perfectly well without it, and being able to empty the base could be useful.2. It is NECESSARY to install the screw that fixes the post holder to the base.  If you don't, it leaves a hole in the base and whatever you filled it with will come out (yes, I found this out the hard way).  The nut welded onto the side of the post holder fits into a slot in the base.  You may need to hammer or sledge the post holder into the base to get the nut to line up with the hole.  If you fill yours with water, you may want to add a rubber washer to prevent leakage.That said -- it looks good (and matches my umbrella :) ) and I think the umbrella will break before it goes anywhere."

RUST","UPDATE:  My plans of using caulking and paint to stop the rusting hasn't worked as well as I'd hoped.  It's keeping the rust from leaking on to the pool deck, but has now caused an abundant amount of rust on the bottom of the umbrella pole.  I'm not quite convinced that the manufacture understands the importance of using stainless steel hardware for the screw that mounts the post to the plastic base. If you don't like rust, you won't like this stand - I'm in Arizona, not much rain or moisture here, I'd hate to see the rust when used in a coastal region or rainy state!The design of this base is contemporary, not too bulky, and works well compared to the others I've bought.  I'd like to mention it's well-built despite one modification I made.  The product states stainless steel parts, but the bolt that hold the umbrella holder to the base is painted steel.  It's also tack welded so it can't be removed and replaced with a stainless bolt.  Since water can sit between the support post and the base it's a potential for rust, which other reviews have stated.  I simply painted the bottom of the bolt and used clear caulking to seal off the gaps between the posts and base to prevent water from getting to the bolt; this should prevent rust from occurring and staining my deck.USE SAND NOT WATER (using a funnel) for an extremely stable weight."

Thus I bought the version with the pipe that makes it a stand, and a bit more tip resistant. I *could* have used the plain base, but for a few dollars more it seemed reasonable to get this version.The stand itself is a reasonably basic, empty molded plastic base, with a short metal tube that attaches to stabilize the umbrella.The stand itself can be filled with sand or gravel, or even mixed concrete if you wish (but this would be tricky). The filling opening is a bit small, but with a decent funnel and dry sand filling should be pretty easy. My sand was a tad wet, so filling was a bit tricky as it tended to clog the funnel (as others have found).I found the stand to be a fraction of an inch (~ 1/8') too thick to fit well under my table. The middle of the table legs sat on the edge of the plastic, causing the table to not sit on the deck and rock. Since the difference was slight, I marked where the legs sat on the plastic. I then used a heat gun to soften the plastic a bit and mashed small indents into the plastic with a metal pipe. (note: I don't recommend this unless you've played with reforming plastics before. It is easy to over melt them, making them runny, sticky and prone to causing nasty burns if they drip on you.)After this slight venture in dangerous warranty voiding, the product works great  We've had a few thunderstorms with strong winds whip through since, and I've not been worried about the umbrella tipping (at least with it closed.. I'd not trust the stand to hold a 9' open umbrella in place with 40 mph wind gusts..).For its appearance, well, it is plastic, and looks like.. plastic.

During a Halloween event I actually had a kid ask me if it was hot. He wouldn't believe me until I let him put his hand through it, so it's pretty convincing.But there is a downside too. A couple of them.I received 4 working torches, but from what I hear they don't all arrive that way. Since I ordered one of them has stopped working. That might be because I dropped it, though.These have two battery compartments, one to run the motor and one to run the light. Either one can fail. The one that died on me still has a working light, but no blower.Finally, even when they are working perfectly they are kind of noisy. The motor is not exactly the highest quality and makes a loud continuous hum.In conclusion I gave this three stars because they worked pretty well for me. If you can get past the flaws you'll have yourself a decent illusion. If not.. Well, keep looking. Maybe there's a higher end battery operated torch somewhere."

When the rented costumes arrived, these were the flames placed inside of things that looked like candles for Lumiere's hands. Unfortunately, one of them was in 2 peices & we couldn't fix it. With 2 days to go before opening night, luckily I found this on amazon and ordered 1. I figured that we would plop it in there and the problem would be solved. It arrived as promised 3 hours before the curtain was supposed to go up, but didn't work properly. Having the switch on 'on' made the fan work, but not the light. Turning the switch to 'off' made the fan go faster and it was very noisy but the light worked too...weird. I figured OK, by unscrewing the bottom a little, you could control it to go on & off with just the right press with a finger or thumb, it would have to be good enough. But I still wanted it to work the right way. After messing with it & trying to figure out if a wire was just in a wrong place, I realized that I hadn't put any thought into how the batteries were in there. There weren't any directions & maybe they were just not in there right. After all, everything did work, just not the way it was supposed to. I swiched them around to different combinations and at one time even had it sucking air instead of blowing, but finally found the correct combination. Once the batteries were in corretly, it worked perfectly. It wasn't noisy, nor did it cause any problems with the mics on stage. Although this is rather delicate and I would not recommend it for small kids, it did serve the purpose and I am delighted with the purchase. Battery placement: top half - buttons down, bottom half - buttons up."
